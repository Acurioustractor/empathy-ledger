# Empathy Ledger

Transforming how stories create impact through dignity, agency, and ethical value exchange.

## Vision

Empathy Ledger represents a paradigm shift in how stories are shared, valued, and amplified—placing dignity at the center, recognizing the storyteller as hero, and creating measurable pathways from narrative to action.

## Core Principles

1. **Dignity-Centered Design**: Every interaction enhances rather than diminishes human dignity
2. **Narrative Agency**: Storytellers maintain complete control over their narratives
3. **Ethical Value Exchange**: Transparent systems for fair compensation and recognition
4. **Impact Measurement**: Comprehensive tracking of stories' transformative effects
