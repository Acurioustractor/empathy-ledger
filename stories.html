You want to know my life story? Okay. Got two girls. I started out life as a teacher, working life as a teacher.\n\nDidn't like that and got a job in local government, so I ended up the last job I had there for 20 years. And then after I retired, I discovered orange sky and my husband got sick. And he subsequently died. And Orange Sky, as I've told Nic, saved me. It made me get out of bed every day, try and push through the grief, and it's just been the best thing I've ever done, apart from having a lovely family.\n\nOh, I love it. I just absolutely love it. I honestly believe. [00:01:00] That we give a lot to friends, but they give just as much back. I go home on top of the world some days. Yeah. And I look forward to the days that I'm on shift. I love it. Really love it.\n\nIt was compounded, my husband had myeloma and the life expectancy of myeloma now is seven years, and he died after about. Three and a half. So he didn't last very long. But grief for my husband dying was a second wave of grief because six weeks before he died, our 42-year-old son-in-law just died suddenly in Sydney, leaving a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.\n\nAnd my daughter. And totally unexpected, just completely out of left field. And he was the most wonderful human being. He was [00:02:00] American. And then later on, Ron died. And that was, I think I no, I was in denial of how sick he was. Every time we went to the hematologist, I would. Feel, oh, it wasn't that bad.\n\nIt could have been worse, but something happened to his spleen and he just said one night, I feel like I've got a pain in my chest. So I thought it might have been a heart. His heart went into hospital, didn't come out. And ended up in ICU for a week, which was horrible. Horrible. And then went into palliative care and died the next day.\n\nSo it was, but he had also been an orange sky volunteer, so I felt like I was carrying on the family tradition too by continuing to do that. But it truly did help me get out of bed. I had to, I had no choice. People depending on you, and without that, I [00:03:00] probably could have stayed. But everybody I know has said to me how well I've coped.\n\nAnd I think I've coped reasonably well. But I, I miss him. Of course .\n\nI do on my shift on Thursday, we've got, that's the longest shift we've had.\n\nIt's the oldest shift and we, the team, I've got the two boys I volunteer with, we've been together for years, probably five years. Or Russ has probably been there nearly seven years. And yes, they were supportive. I was very touched that the team leaders all went to Ron's funeral. Very unexpected. And they've helped me a lot.\n\nBut the interesting thing was that the friends. Where my shift on Thursday is the friends knew him too. That was nice, there was a consistency there. But I just I just love it. Absolutely love it. Are there particular things about it that you think are [00:04:00] more profound than others or because I think there's some parts of the, so just simple, but some parts thought out. I think it's, yes, the laundry's important obviously for. People's dignity and they have a right to that. But I think making them feel seen and heard, for me personally, that's really important and genuinely, calling them by name and remembering to ask them something.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes is from Maya Angelou says, people will forget what you said, forget what you did. But they will never forget the way you made them feel. And I really believe that. I think that is true for me, but I try to make that true for them too. So I'll, we'll talk about something that's meaningful to them.\n\nI think one of the trickier things is learning to respect and know the [00:05:00] boundaries because some people don't wanna share that much. And we've got a friend who we would, we are very frustrated. We really wanna be able to help him, but he feels that he has enough and he doesn't want to take anymore.\n\nAnd he struggles, but I've since found out he has got an advocate, which is really good. But that's a failing in the system. I think this particular friend is quite deaf and he's waited probably 18 months to get hearing aids, and I don't know how much they've shown him, but we had a volunteer on the shift one day who'd had some experience as an audiologist.\n\nSo she showed him how to put them in and he said, oh, I can hear now, but I don't, he's not doing it himself and we can't offer he's quite private. And he's quite proud, which we respect.\n\nI'm up to my nine years this year, and I wanna get my 10 years, then I'll get my unpaid long service leave.\n\nNo, I just, that is [00:06:00] a very concrete goal. I want to get to my 10 years. I've got no intention of leaving at this stage. Sometimes some of the processes that come from HQ can be a bit frustrating. I have to say though, I'd like this on record that my regional coordinator, Carolyn, is superb.\n\nShe is the best I've ever worked with. She is just amazing. Her level of support to me as service leader is immeasurable. So she's a buffer between me and the powers that be.\n\nWhat do you think or hope might happen in the next 10 years or in 10 years time? Oh, that's a good question. On a grassroots level, I hope they keep doing what they're doing. And I hope. They don't diverge too much [00:07:00] from that so that they're trying to do so many things and nothing gets done really well. I remember at the last summit I went to, they were talking about going to San Francisco, and I remember saying Then you need to get it working effectively here before you go anywhere else.\n\nI would like to see, a little bit more acknowledgement of a lot of the services. Like anybody who knew me 9, 8, 9 years ago knew that. I always said, we get forgotten down here. And it, I get that we are a long way away. I understand that. But there are times when we. We can't do the things they can do on the mainland.\n\nSo we left feeling a little bit out of things. But in terms of. The the volunteers, I think always uppermost in the minds of the staff should be [00:08:00] what the volunteers are doing because without the volunteers you have no orange sky, you have no ladder to climb, you have nothing. And I think I do what I can for, to acknowledge my team.\n\nWe've got a fabulous team of team leaders, wonderful volunteers, absolutely awesome. But sometimes it's nice to. Know that they're appreciated by others. And it's simple things like, it's our birthday in July last year. They put in the newsletter in the Spin Cycles services, birthdays.\n\nThey didn't put ours in last year. They forgot it. And that's, I know I get that we are one of however many services in Australia, but to us we are the service in Tassie. So that sort of thing upsets me a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm proud of Orange Sky. I'm very proud of Orange Sky. I'm proud to volunteer for it. I'm proud of what it [00:09:00] does. And it's, there's nothing better than when I drive to my shift on Wednesday.\n\nAnthony's there waving when I drive the van in, and, it's just such a positive experience all round. But I do think, I do think that they're going to have to be very careful that they don't lose sight of that up there. \n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"14:T1c22,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"# Robyn Watts\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRobin Watts.

Finally got my Visa last year, May 2nd, 2024. That was 16 days before my birthday, and it was a blessing year. And now I've been living in.\n\nAustralia for six months or something now. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's life been like for you, I guess for the last little bit in Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh, I think Australia is the most beautiful country in the world, and I think Melbourne. Yeah, definitely is a beautiful place. Yeah, I've been in two places only that's in.\n\nDanon and Brook, the Sunshine Victoria in Melbourne. And I like it. Yeah, [00:01:00] I like both places. Yeah. But I became homeless just seven weeks ago seven months ago. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's that experience been like for you?\n\nSpeaker 12: It's been challenging and I think it's rewarding too at the same time because I learned a lot of things I lost a lot too.\n\nBut there's a challenging part is losing a lot of friends. You are losing trust in everybody, especially the government. And then you tend to wanna blame and point fingers at, others. But at the end of the day, I think everybody deserves a place to sleep, place access to, water and electricity.\n\nAnd as for me, as a refugee. [00:02:00] Who seek for asylum in here. And I came and I got, they gave me asylum. I think these rights, I have to acknowledge that I need to make myself work harder to find another accommodation for myself. So I have a, shelter and. Electricity, water and all this.\n\nYeah. Otherwise, I'm not a human being, I cannot, I have to work harder to do this. Yeah. To find a house to live in. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's all right.\n\nSpeaker 13: What was life like in, in Fiji before you came?\n\nSpeaker 12: Life was very hard. I think it's harder than. It is very difficult, harder than what I've harder than what I've experienced in my life in here.\n\nBut I've seen other people in here [00:03:00] too who are homeless who I think they face it harder than even in my country. I think my country is easier. In here, it's very difficult because it's twofold. You can see the good and the bad, but that's advantage and disadvantage from me leaving my country and from me living in here.\n\nLike in my country, you don't look at the clock. You don't really be punctual in Australia it is different. It's very difficult because the homeless people and all this, they're struggling because why they have to be punctual and pay fees and all these things and all, especially when they don't have job and all this is more difficult.\n\nYeah. But in my country, the only thing is the violence is the scary part. Yeah. The violence is, yeah. [00:04:00] There's no limit. That's the thing. So it's extreme violence. Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 13: what made you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Since we got my country got independence from Australia in 1975. After that, only like my parents. They're like citizens of Australia because they were born before we got independence, but they don't get recognized for that. They haven't got a, their citizenship or anything for me. Yes. I was born after 1975. I can get a, I can't get a, passport and all this fight for my rights to come here, but that wasn't the case.\n\nMy parents fight for the right to come here too, and then I fight for my right to come here. It doesn't make sense to me. It is no common sense, but it's all right. God put the law in for some reason. I don't know. We'll work it out later, but I think it's not right. It's not right because if you are born in a country while it's still Australia, [00:05:00] you are a citizen of Australia automatically.\n\nAnd I thought it was only my parents, but I find that, half of the Korean mob and the Torres Strait Islander mob and all the ma everybody, most of the aboriginals, they don't have the citizenship too. So I think we are all in the same boat. So there's nothing to, what was the question again?\n\nSpeaker 13: Why did you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh yeah. Why I came to Australia? Yeah, because I know this this. My mother country, this is my homeland. This is my mother country, so I still have right to come here. But I didn't come. All my family and everybody, they came here before maybe 1997. Even, I don't know if I were, when I was younger, I came, I don't know.\n\nI can't remember because a lot of traveling. Around the country within PNG and here too, but I can't remember most of [00:06:00] it when I was younger. I only, the only thing I can remember is from 1993 up, when I started going to school. Yeah. After that there were a lot of tribal conflicts in my village.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So my parents have been like, they're basically like vol, voluntary workers. They're born again Christians. My father was a heavy diesel equipment fitter, and my mother was a principal at one of the secondary high schools in p and g, and then she became a community office officer for the mining company in my country.\n\nYeah. And she got some more degrees on top of her teaching and all this, and she. Yeah, she's basically the breadwinner of my family.\n\nAs a result, inherited a lot of land [00:07:00] back at home because most of my family, they come and grow up here, so my sister and my brother, and my mother's sister. So because of my land titles, my life is in danger. Because I received land royalties. Yeah. So they want to kill me. I had to take myself out of my country.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'm the first born in my male in my country. In my family. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the situation daily for you in Australia now? What's the main things in which you're working on or working towards, or what do you do today?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah the first thing I'm working on is basically to get to know the people.\n\nKnow the system here, the street, the bus service is very difficult because if you grow up here, you can instinctively make decisions like what to do, where to go, what number to go. It is not like that. Every day I wake up to check the number again, [00:08:00] because I'm not sure which bus I'm getting on.\n\nAnd I keep on asking the traffic officers and all this, and the people here are very helpful and very, I think Australia is Australian and the community in Melbourne especially, they're good people. They help a lot. Yeah. And\n\nSpeaker 13: Are you using the Sky Service? What do you think of Orange Sky and what they're doing?\n\nSpeaker 12: I think orange sky, I've seen it where in, on TV and all this. And I think I really appreciate the work they do and yeah, I highly recommend the people who fund and support these services. Yeah. God bless you all, like you, you got a heart, heart of gold and I really appreciate your support for the sky orange. People, I'd like to be a volunteer too, to help wash the clothes for like this, but I'm not sure how it's gonna work because that's the only thing. I have. The trolley, if you can take the picture there it [00:09:00] is. Just the trolley there. Yeah.\n\nThat's my only problem because\n\nI never been in Australia, homeless in winter, but summer is all right. That's why I take a lot of clothes there in there. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 13: And what's why do you think like this idea of connection and being able to talk to people is important?\n\nThat's part of what Orange sky does. Why is, why do humans need other people and other people to talk to?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think because it's very lonely world for me. For me, I think I'm lonely. I'm lonely maybe because. I enjoy other things and all this. Maybe I'm not I don't have a partner, that's why I'm lonely or something.\n\nBut I'm straight just for information looking for a girl. I have some of my partner ex-partners back in p and g, but since I come here, I have to start a new life, but it's very difficult for me. I can't get over it. Yeah. Like starting a new life here. Yeah. Yeah, I still have [00:10:00] my family back at home.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's like some things in which you do to connect with people in Australia\n\nSpeaker 12: In Australia, basically, I just most of the time I just say hello to people, meet them on the road. But sometimes I drink drink alcohol once in a while, and when I drink, I feel more open to speak to people and yeah, I meet a lot of people here.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But\n\nSpeaker 13: do you meet a lot of other people that are not from Australia and do you connect in that way as well or do you make most\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I meet a lot of people not from Australia and Yeah. But I'm very curious about the, how the real Australian, like how the Australians are. The culture and all this, how they speak and all this.\n\nI try to follow, learn the accent, the lingo. But I think if they speak in the ling the slangs I don't understand. They, I seen a lot of, when they get to the, they start using [00:11:00] the slangs and all this, they know. Yeah. And it's a different level. Yeah. Yeah. I can't read it, but I understand.\n\nYeah, I understand. That's cool.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the next sort of steps for you? What do you wanna do next?\n\nSpeaker 12: The next step for me is after I understand the system, I'm gonna be like, five years. Five years I won't work because that's, I promise that already, because five years, actually seven years I fight for my visa, and finally after seven years, I got it.\n\nSo seven years I will stay. I am like a, a baby, newborn baby. I'm still growing. When I become seven years old, I will understand what to do and then I will start working there.\n\nYeah. I will start working after seven years, but now I'm so mentally tormented because I've been institutionalized and I tried working.\n\nI was working with the [00:12:00] brick laying and all these things. I just walk one day. Yeah. But I couldn't I'm a process technician. Even just fixing a bicycle. I can't do it. I try to change the wheel, change that tube. I can't do it because I can't concentrate. It takes like over two to three hours just changing the tire.\n\nSo I've been mentally affected too. Yeah. I got stabbed here. Two times here. Two times here, two times here. I'm a victim of one punch coward assault. Yeah. They punched me here too. And I fell down. Actually I was on the balcony and they punched me and I fell down because I was dead drunk, so I fell down and the cement broke my jaw.\n\nI got four screws here. Four screws. Yeah. Yes. From my fractured jaw. And then I got hit by a, I got hit by a [00:13:00] car. It's like it was lady, she stopped by the traffic light. I was coming on a bike trying to go and do a inspection. House inspection. Yeah. I come and then there was green light was on. And then she stopped.\n\nAll the cars went and she stopped. And so I took off. When I took off, she took off again and she hit me again. And then she hit me. I went to the air five meters up, landed on my head, bro. Yeah, to my ligament, spine, ligament. And then what happened was the police come to question me, take me to the hospital in all.\n\nI said no, it's all right. It's not her because she was a Muslim lady. She just pick her children and she was crying too. So I feel sorry. Like I said, no she didn't do anything. And then I woke up and I went to the hospital myself. Yeah. And that's another that's the third incident I got.[00:14:00]\n\nSo I got a lot of injuries when I came to Australia too. Yeah. Yeah. What's, what other\n\nSpeaker 13: services do you use at the moment? What are the types of things in which,\n\nSpeaker 12: I use the sender link. I use the Salvation Army, I use the library for shower, and whenever I want to do a like con. Do internet, like search some things.\n\nFree wifi. I go to the library. I even use the console wifi sometimes when I don't have data. What else do I use? I use the bus services and the train services. Most of the times I don't have the, my key, but I think the officers I used to miss understand. But they're really there to help me. Yeah.\n\nI think. Yeah. Yeah. What,\n\nSpeaker 13: and what other things do you think would be helpful for you if someone was to be able to support? What are Yeah. Are most [00:15:00] important?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think I would need support to, at least get a job. I really need support to get a job and a house like I'm mentally affected.\n\nI had a mental, independent, psych mental health psych assessment by a doctor, and he found out that I was mentally impaired and he is put a no enough in claim for my compensation. And he says, admit that, but I don't want the money because I don't know how to budget because mentally affected, I can't even work.\n\nBecause I get paranoid, I don't trust anybody. I don't even trust myself. The only thing I trust is I'm praying to God every night or something to gimme some, yeah. But yeah, sometimes I go crazy. Yeah, I try to take things in my own hands, but in my heart I know what is against my religion and I try not to do it.\n\nDo [00:16:00] it a lot, get angry at someone or get violent or something like that is no good. And I'm trying to learn how to live here. Yeah. But it's overwhelming because the culture shock. Yeah. Yeah. But I think it'll be all good. Yeah. Thanks to people like you and the Orange Sky team and all this, I think we are blessed to have, people who do this work and who support us like this. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Yeah.

I'm widowed. I, my husband died a long time ago. Uh, I've got two grown up daughters and four grandsons. Um, so when I retired, um, I'm actually, I'm involved in a charity in Bali.\n\nUh, where we run a, I'm a massive animal lover and we run a des sexing [00:01:00] program for dogs and cats. And when Covid hit. I couldn't travel to Bali. I couldn't do any fundraising here, so I looked, I'd just retired. So I looked around for basically something to fill my time because Covid destroyed my retirement plans.\n\nMm-hmm. Um, and I found these guys on the website. I think I Googled volunteering opportunities or. Something like that because I didn't want to work with food and I didn't want to work in an op shop. And I went, oh, that looks good. And here I am, not quite four years later, I do usually twice a week. Um, yeah.\n\nSo good to be able. I love it. I love it here. It's, um, it's friendly. I live quite close to here and I actually know. Some of the people that come here, I see, oh, I don't really know them, [00:02:00] but I run into them in the shops and we have a chat and um, it's, you know, it's nice. It's a very homey sort of community around here.\n\nA bit different to some of the other challenging places that I travel to. Some of them are a bit more challenging than here. Here is very easy, very friendly, as you can see. Mm-hmm. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Awesome spot.\n\nSpeaker 16: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: What's, um. Um, is there something that's changed in you from starting to volunteer to now in terms of like maybe what help is or what homelessness is or anything around those types of things?\n\nUm,\n\nSpeaker 16: yeah, I think, I think, I think there, well we do, we do in here and we come across quite a few genuinely homeless. People, there's a lot of people living in their cars. Um, a lot of people live up in the mountains in the national park. Mm-hmm. You know, they'll [00:03:00] pitch a tent somewhere quiet up there. But most of the people that we deal with here, and also at Dandenong, where I go quite a lot, are not really homeless, but more disadvantaged and being able to help, you know, even if it's just your.\n\n10 or $15 a week to go to the laundromat to come here, I think makes a huge difference to their finances. Mm-hmm. Um, you know, I'm fortunate enough that I don't have to live on a tiny little pension, but, you know, it, it's a tough gig, um, especially for people who've gotta pay rent, doesn't leave them with very much.\n\nSo a lot of the people, they come here for a meal. They might come here for meals, they'll get their washing done, they go somewhere else tomorrow night for a meal. A lot of them travel to three or four different places through the week. Um, [00:04:00] which, you know, obviously helps out. Um, so yeah, I, I think let, there's, well, don't get me wrong, I, I'm not saying that there's not an issue with homelessness because there most certainly is, but, um.\n\nCertainly around here. Uh, it's not as much as I thought it would be, or they're just not coming here. There are, there are lots of, still lots of homeless people around here. There's a couple of guys that I see sitting outside the supermarkets and stuff that I never see come here. You know, I stop and have a chat to them and tell them about this place, but they don't want to come.\n\nA lot of them don't. They wanna be just left alone. Mm-hmm. Um, so yeah. Yeah. So I guess in that way it's, it's changed.\n\nSpeaker 15: What's, I'm really interested in this idea of like, what is a story and how do people tell them? What's the idea of stories around the van, I guess? And are those stories powerful for you, for the people that come?\n\nOh [00:05:00] look,\n\nSpeaker 16: what's that like? Well, I think, uh, a lot of the people that come here look on us as their counselors. Um, we get told lots of stuff that probably don't. Need to know. Um, and, but it, it's good. I love it that they're comfortable enough, people are comfortable enough to come and tell us their troubles.\n\nUm, yeah, I mean obviously I'm not gonna share the stories that they tell us 'cause it's their, their stories. But, um, yeah, we do, we do hear lots and I'm sure they'd be happy to tell you. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: And what's, what's, where, where do you think that role of the volunteer is most, you know, more important? Like,\n\nSpeaker 16: well, it is definitely as a pseudo counselor, as well as, and, and a lot of the people that come here, uh, especially don't get their washing done, but they still come out and have a chat and, [00:06:00] you know, tell us their, they tell us their troubles.\n\nThey tell us the good stuff as well. Um, yeah, so. Uh, yeah, I think, um, certainly there's, there's certainly more to orange skies than doing people's washing. Um, and you know, we've become quite close to, to the point where if they're not here, I worry about them, which Steve in there always says, don't worry.\n\nThey, they come back. But I'll go home and worry about where, you know, somebody that I think is a bit vulnerable is if I don't see them the following week. Mm. Um, I've probably got better at that over the, over the four years. Yeah. Don't lay awake at night as much as I used to. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Wow.\n\nSpeaker 16: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 15: Um, what's been part of growth or enjoyment or whatever for you for this?\n\nLike what, what, why do you keep coming back? Oh, personally,\n\nSpeaker 16: [00:07:00] uh, look, people volunteer for all sorts of different reasons and, um, you know. Some of the volunteers that I've met, some, some of them do it to get hours on a uni degree or on a course or something. Some do it. I, I grew up in a family. We volunteered.\n\nI was brought up to always give back. Um, my mother was a doer, you know, she was involved in, she was one of those ladies that did that, did the flowers, and polished the brass, and she was a girl guide leader and. It's just, I don't, I don't know. It's just a thing I've always, I've always done. And once I retired, I was able to do more of it.\n\nAnd as I said, covid, I probably wouldn't have done it without Covid 'cause I would've just continued doing my, um, barley gig. Um, but I had time on my hands and I'm not good at having time on my hands. I have to fill my [00:08:00] time. Sure. So, yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, volunteering's just what. You know what people do, you, people either do, they're either a giver or a taker, I guess, but you know, and personally, you, you know, you, it makes you, it makes you feel good to help people, um, makes you feel good inside to know that you've helped somebody.\n\nYou are even, you know, just, and, and some people are so grateful to have their washing done. People who are genuinely homeless and you're able to give them. Especially in winter, you know, a nice basket of nice folded, clean, dry, nice smelling, washing makes them feel really good. So it makes me feel good.\n\nThat's really it. So\n\nSpeaker 15: awesome. Yeah. So good.

Transition out period? So this is what I found hard. While I knew I was getting out, I had a sentence date.

I was doing really well and she sold everything I had. I had nothing to go back to. So I was trying to find places, for example, caravan, parks everywhere.

When she had a child, she had 75 percent brain damage. It took 10 years to get to walk and talk, but she tried and tried every day to get better.\n\nIt's called, the book is called, Waiting for the Sunshine, One Day at a Time.\n\nSpeaker 11: Tell me a little bit more about yourself.\n\nDavid: Ah, yeah, I don't know what to say. I was born in England and then we [00:01:00] found that we couldn't get on in England so Jeannie and I was caught in and we decided we'd come to Australia. She put in for Australia first and got permission to come before I could.\n\nSo she got on a big ocean liner and came all the way across the world on her own, just for me. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 10: Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nDavid: So when she was having a child, things went wrong. Obviously I must stand by her because, as I said, she came all the way across the world for me. And then, when she was sick, she had the child, she had 75 percent brain damage, which was caused.\n\nToday, they've got a name for it. It's called a clampsia today. In those earlier days, we didn't know what to call it. But they nursed her and looked [00:02:00] after her at the Hamilton Hospital, which saved her life. It was impossible to believe. How many people came to help me?\n\nSpeaker 11: What's it like having people to help?\n\nWhat does that feel like? Oh,\n\nDavid: it's phenomenal. In those days, you just couldn't believe the kind of help and people that came. It was tremendous. One lady had five children, two adopted children, and offered to take care of Jean's baby for 14 months. I said, because Jean was that ill, she couldn't look after the child at all.\n\nYeah. And so many people helped me along the way, it was unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 11: Have you ever used the Orange Sky for washing?\n\nDavid: Yes, I have. What do you\n\nSpeaker 11: think of Orange Sky?\n\nDavid: Oh, I think it's a terrific idea. Especially nowadays that things are getting tough. And you need somewhere to bring it to. If [00:03:00] you're sleeping in your car, or anywhere, sleeping about, you need to be able to bring everything down to get washed and cleaned.\n\nAnd these meals that's out and about is tremendous. We really couldn't do without them. What's it\n\nSpeaker 11: Having people to talk to and having a community? What's it like having people to talk to and a community? Yeah,\n\nDavid: Of course, we come round these places. To meet people and talk with them and keep you associated with what's going on and around you.\n\nMakes a big difference, yeah. Oh yeah, you'd be terribly lonely and stuck if you were just at home on your own and not able to get out and see these people. Yeah, absolutely. But it's surprising how many of them you meet in so many different places, all the same situation. Oh yeah, it's terrific.\n\nSpeaker 11: Do you get to talk to lots of different people here?\n\nDo they have lots of different stories [00:04:00] and experiences? Oh yes,\n\nDavid: everybody that comes to these. Food, places, or meals. Of course they have different stories and have worked different ways in life. I said, and then found myself completely stuck because I said it's changed now. If you haven't got it, you will never be able to get it at the moment in Australia.\n\nIt's just got beyond the working man to be able to afford to live.\n\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. And,\n\nWhat's what are some things next for you? I've got some, tell me more about the book and like what you're doing with it.\n\nDavid: Yeah, with the book it encourages people that Say they've lost their job, they've got two or three children, the bank's knocking on the door for the house, and they're going to lose their house or their car.\n\nThe book encourages them to show what you can get through as long as you've got your partner and stay together. There's nothing like having reasonable good health, [00:05:00] your partner and your family. Nothing else matters. The house and the car doesn't even matter at all. What difference does it make? You lose the house but as long as you've got your family and your partner then you've got everything.\n\nSpeaker 11: I'm really interested in stories. What do you, and you've obviously written a book. Why do you think stories are important and why do you think books are important? I\n\nDavid: think the story is so important in the book because it encourages people to stay together and to be able to get through tough times.\n\nAs I said, Jeannie was so ill, it took 10 years to get her to walk and talk. It took 30 years for, to try and run a home. I said, but that's the why the story is really going very well. It, for these times when things are tough and you're struggling so much, it really helps you with the [00:06:00] family and stay together.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: If you were to tell someone why they should buy the book, this is your chance, why should people buy the book?\n\nDavid: They'll never remember or they won't have nothing left from their legacy or their entire life of struggling or the way they've gone through life. So if you can write a book about your life, how you started, how you found your partner and how you progressed and struggled through life, this is why you need to write a book.\n\nBecause you won't have a legacy to leave behind unless you've got a book of your life story.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what do you hope happens with the book? What do you hope is the outcome\n\nDavid: of it? We're hoping that it'll help a lot of people that's struggling. And there's so many people came to me and said, Oh look, you've wrote a book.\n\nfor sharing the book with me. Because she'd got three [00:07:00] children and was losing the house to the bank. And she was in tears when she thanked me for sharing the story. I said, this is what the story's about. It's to try and get people to stay together. And be together, I said, this is a, this is what it's about, it's to get you through tough times, when you think you're struggling and having bad times, you can understand how, if you stay together, you can get through it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what's where are you going back to tonight? Where are you staying, and what's that like?\n\nDavid: Pardon?\n\nSpeaker 11: Where are you staying\n\nDavid: at the moment? Oh, I've got my own house. So I'll be going home to my house. But of course I'm on my own now, so it makes an awful difference. Without coming round for these meals and coming to these places, oh, it's such a hard time staying and living on your own.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: It was amazing to hear your [00:08:00] story. I'm going to buy one of your books. Yes. On Amazon? Buy it on Amazon?\n\nDavid: Yes, buy it from Amazon.\n\nSpeaker 11: Amazing.\n\nDavid: Yes. Cool. You will thoroughly enjoy it, and you'll be amazed on how many people. Like the story because it gets them to stay together and none of this family violence and all that.\n\nJust please understand that you've met together in the first place because you wanted to.

It's a beautiful part of the world to be, um, I've got a real heart for, for community and for people finding their place.\n\nAnd so particularly the community meal night, there's nothing better than someone finding their place at the table with cutlery on one side and salt and pepper and flowers. It's a really beautiful thing. Uh, it's that great equalizer. Once you sit around the table, you find community, uh, and everyone's the same.\n\nSpeaker 8: That's [00:01:00] amazing. What's this soaring sky community thing? What, like how does that match together and does it match together? Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 9: so part of that table, it's all that dignity. And so a big, a big thing of what we want to do is dignity. Uh, and so something like orange sky, uh, is a, is a, is a great service for some of our folks who, uh.\n\nThat is not a, a lived experience for them. They're not able to access clean clothes, and when you don't have clean clothes, you don't feel very good. You get really stinky. Uh, we've got some people who, um, uh, need to be applying for jobs as well. So when you don't have good clothes, you feel stinky, you feel pretty rubbish about yourself.\n\nSo Orange Sky's a great service and it means that people can access, uh, fresh, clean clothes and it just, you know, it has amazing boost to their mental health and general wellbeing.\n\nSpeaker 8: Something about this place, philosophy, values, safety. What it's, what, what do you think that provides A safe place where people feel like that's, they want to all do that.\n\nYep. You know what I mean? I don't see any behavior that is like, um, sort of [00:02:00] going outta the, the mold or causing any trouble. Yep. Where does that come from and how does that get built?\n\nSpeaker 9: Yeah, so I think a big thing for us is, you know, we, we, this mill here is in the Furniture Gallery village and the village is, it's off Berwood Highway.\n\nNot many people go through it. It, it kind of comes from a real sense for me around the local community and care for community. You know, when you know your neighbor, when you know their friend, you take care of them. And so I think a similar thing is translated here. We're in a smaller community, but people really care for one another.\n\nAnd when you get to see the lived experiences, you hear the stories for, for some of our folks, they hear similar stories from one another. And I think when you combine stories, people together and food, there's this beautiful fermentation of, of community care and it can be people at their best,\n\nSpeaker 8: so Right.\n\nUm, this whole idea of conversation, so the lens itself more to me, that term [00:03:00] story, how does stories. Continue to build what you have here and what, what do you think should happen with those stories over time? Yeah. Like, and how does that continue to support the longevity and the future of this place?\n\nSpeaker 9: So stories are really powerful.\n\nStories are a reminder of past, they're a reminder of emotion and feeling and experience. But quite often that those experiences are the foundation for what the future looks like. So I think about people that live in boarding houses. Hearing their perspective and ongoingly hearing their perspective is a really important thing because it's a reminder of how people in the community live who are much worse off than me.\n\nAnd whether it's boarding houses or people that sleep in tents in the forests, or people who are sleeping in cars, we, they have lots of those people. Uh, we can't forget those stories. We need to keep hearing those stories, uh, because they remind us and, and really encourage us of the importance of this sort of thing.\n\nUh, because there's lots of [00:04:00] complex reasons why people don't have secure housing. Uh, but bigger than that, what we can do is we can provide a place of safety and that one piece of safety, that one bit of, uh, listening to story, uh, can have ripple effects that go well and truly beyond just one community meal night.\n\nThey allow us to, uh, think bigger ongoing, what we can do to make a difference.\n\nSpeaker 8: Um, those stories, how do. Ripple out to people that at the moment don't really care or don't have access to knowing what's actually happening. For people that are struggling, is there a chance to, I dunno if it's changing people's minds or even just touching a few more people.\n\nMm. Is there a better way to do that? Like, do you have to force feed naturally? What's the way in which you do that in a way that's like you have here, right? Like a natural. Experience organic.\n\nSpeaker 9: I think it's a bit of everything. I think, you know, our world is so fast paced now. Social media is, is running at [00:05:00] lightning pace.\n\nI think it's a few different things. I, I think it's, it, it is certainly around messaging in a really tight, short space, getting the powerful message out there, whether that's social media or whether that's in some other form. I think it's that. But I, I, I think more than that, I, I, I, I think it's, it's the long.\n\nA difficult discipline driver, just continuing to say the same thing again and again and again. Uh, and that's can be challenging and you get a bit frustrated. Uh, but I think, you know, it's, it's seems like connecting with your local ministers. It's, you know, it's politicians, it's department heads, it's other agencies that we work with who should have a footprint here.\n\nThey say they do, but they don't. Uh, so it's, it's, it's the long hard stuff where you just have to keep, uh, advocating for people. Hmm. Uh, at a corporate level, at a government level, at a support level. Uh, because if you don't do that, the, the story just gets lost and life just moves on.\n\nSpeaker 8: And last question.\n\nYou're doing such a good job. Um, I do a lot with [00:06:00] young people, especially young people that have, um, too much contact with this system of youth justice and those areas is, do you see young people here? And then also what do.\n\nWhat's, what's that opportunity to capture those kids that maybe like, it's not cool to come here? Or like, what's that maybe here?\n\nSpeaker 9: So, yeah. Yeah. Great question. So I think going back to the ideas of community, I think I've been a young person, uh, I know what it's like not to fit in. Uh, and so I think, you know, particular I'm thinking about young men particularly.\n\nYou need mob, you need people that, that where you have a sense of identity and a sense of security that comes from that. That's missing in a lot of young men, particularly girls as well. That sense of a, your story within a bigger story, that stuff is missing. So I think something like a meal night here, we can't do all of that.\n\nBut if you can get a young person engaged [00:07:00] developmentally with older people, with people who might be different from you, but have an interest in you and show an interest in you, that over time can begin to make a difference. So I think there's lots of things that we can be doing better to engage the younger people.\n\nUm, but I'd be really, really keen to see what else we can do because I fully appreciate people need purpose. People need a place to call home. People need a place where they see themselves within a bigger story and places where that doesn't happen, that can lead down a really difficult path.\n\nSpeaker 8: Geez, jeez, dude."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1b:T586,The Power of Community: Finding Equality at the Table\n===\n\nSpeaker 9: ~And so particularly the community meal night, there's nothing better than someone finding their place at the table with cutlery on one side and salt and pepper and flowers.

Alright, so just your full name and spell it. Sorry, one more time. Yeah. Julie Jaunty. J-U-L-I-E, jaunty, J-A-U-N-C-E-Y. Tell us a tiny little about yourself first. I'm in my mid fifties. I used to do nursing. I gardener unexpectedly had a stroke four and a half years ago. Otherwise, I wouldn't be coming here today 'cause I've lost function in one hand.\n\nAnd even though I've got a washing machine, having this services invaluable because I can't take online or go up and down steps. So unlikely people are using this service. I really appreciate it. That's cool. Casper, what are you doing? What's what's the last few years been like? The last four years have been a bit crazy.\n\nEverything was blamed on Covid. I had literally my straight, literally when Covid happened, all the hospitals got closed down and services. So it's just been quite difficult accessing services. I've just had to work out different ways of getting things done that I had to, thankfully, because where I used to [00:01:00] work.\n\nI knew we used to get a lot of people up and moving, so I know you've just got to keep moving and grooving and yeah, that was really fortunate. Tell us tell us a bit about the, how you feel being at shift is what, like what sort of shift? Six shift. Oh. I come here on I've only really been coming here the last couple of months because I didn't know about it beforehand.\n\nI found it very helpful. They do a meal, it's like a little camaraderie with a few of the guys that seem to be fairly regular and nice. We've got different ladies that volunteer here, but they also seem to be in a roster. I've seen a few of them a couple of times, and it's just nice to know the washing is washed and dried and I've set for the week.\n\nSuch a simple thing, which for me, I can wash that. I cannot go up and downstairs or hang on my clothes line. So it's been like a massive life save. It's been very helpful. What's the connection like for you here? Like how.\n\nI am like, like I said, I've only been a few months, but everybody seems to [00:02:00] be unusually nice. I was, a bit hesitant. I'm thinking, oh, what sort of people gonna be here? But there's a lovely experience. You've got the regulars, so then you've got some obviously homeless people or people traveling around Australia, whatever.\n\nI'm, I have been surprised that there are people that are literally a holidaying and just i'm living rough for a few weeks so I can get to wherever use the service and that's brilliant. I didn't even know this service existed myself beforehand. That's cool. And what's the, what do you think the main takeaway for you is in terms of what orange Sky does as a whole?\n\nIs it, do you think it's more about the washing, the people connecting the services? I actually. See it's, I do appreciate the washing and especially the drying, but it's the actual, the way the ladies and I've mainly had ladies, we've got she got to, but they just treat you with so well, like you are like bonus friends.\n\nAnd it's just that comradery with some of the workers or volunteers and the the regular people. It's just, I'm really surprised by that. [00:03:00] So That's wonderful. That's good. What, how would you 'cause people struggle, I think to understand what homelessness is, what struggling is, what disadvantage is.\n\nYeah. How do you represent yourself? I guess in that big picture of things, I find myself unusually disadvantaged. I wouldn't have thought I'd be disadvantaged five years ago, but I had a straight four and a half years ago and you cannot access services and so that just made it very difficult. I know I can speak okay, but I walk quite weird and hand functions and what it used to be, so unlikely people.\n\nReally need this service or can access services, but everybody says, oh, wait to go on NOS or wait to. Those things take years and you've gotta get your washing done every week or two weeks. So it's really good to have that service in between. True. And what do you think about life as a whole in terms of the community?\n\nDo you see a lot of struggle or, yeah. I live from Elizabeth, which is like a disadvantaged suburbs supposedly, and I [00:04:00] do see a lot of like homelessness in parks and people going to food vans and all that sort of thing. But I'm. I've only got my advice point of view, but I just think there are a lot of, if people are hungry, especially you can always get food.\n\nBut getting washing done or home, like I know people that are living in cars or doing the couch surfing thing. I. I've got a friend who has only moved to the country. Two years ago she, her and her mom were in long term rental, 19 years. So they presumed it was like their house. They were given three months notice to move by the landlord and they just couldn't afford a place.\n\nSo they bought a dumpy house, middle of nowhere to to stay for roof over their heads. So unexpected people can be homeless. So true. What's it's always interesting to get your take on what this shift is like. So could you walk through how that, how it happened in terms of like A, how did you know about it and then B, what does it feel like?\n\nWhat's it like to be Okay. I heard about like paddle jumpers can paddle [00:05:00] jumpers, and then they, other people told me about the orange sky van, which I thought was very. Help, helpful. I didn't know about it beforehand. I don't use the internet or Facebook or all those sort of normal things 'cause of my funny hand.\n\nSo I was unaware. I'm quite sure that there's advertising, but I just wasn't aware of it. Cool. And what's it what sort of a normal shift look like for you? Normally people try to get here five o'clock for for when the sort of lineup with their washing and the van turns up when it turns up and people are quite happy then people.\n\nYeah, it just seems to be the routine. You get your spot, van turns up, gets something to eat, and then you come back and have a chat around the back of the van. It's mainly being a lady, so it's nice. That's cool. That's awesome. Is there anything that you've always wanted to talk about around Orange Sky yourself that we didn't talk about?\n\nI would like to know how you can advertise it to other people who wouldn't. Like I didn't know about the service point. Who wouldn't normally? [00:06:00] No. 'cause I wouldn't have, I've got a house I wouldn't have considered myself homeless. I wouldn't have known that I needed hands with washing or mainly hanging out.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know how you can actually inform other people. It's a great service. I've been told they go to different places on different days, but I don't quite know if everybody who needs a service knows about it. Seems to be a few regulars turn up, but not other people. Awesome. Such good feedback.\n\nNo worries. I'll I'll have to, yeah. I think the idea with this stuff is like your insight Yeah. And your knowledge Yeah. Is way more than anyone could ever Yeah.

Um, but then eventually it became a little difficult. So, uh, the father suggested that, Hey, why don't you come midweek, do something different.\n\nUm, there's this service running here. Um, I was like, okay, uh, well what is it like? So he described it to me, he said, it's a dinner. You just come and talk. I was like, yeah, great. I'm very good at talking. So, uh, I'll come and talk. Um, more interesting is the listening I've, I've been learning. Um, and uh, actually this is how I met my wife.\n\nWe, we met in soup kitchen back home. Uh, we used to [00:03:00] volunteer at soup kitchen every week for years. Uh, so it's, it's also very, uh, sweet to to be here doing the same thing.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. What's, um, how would you define this idea of connection with people? How do humans connect and why is that important?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great question. Um, humans connect through, I think more than anything, listening, being present in a conversation. Uh, more so listening than talking. Uh, I know, I, I say I love talking, but, but really listening is a lot more powerful in my, in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye, uh, smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt, it builds our fabric together as humanity, uh, to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a, a race, uh, [00:04:00] like um, a bike racer. Someone who worked as. A bodybuilder. People who met here that, you know, lived lives that I've never lived before and I don't think I've ever lived them.\n\nBut through them I'm exposed to part of humanity that I would have no connection with.\n\nSpeaker: That's cool. What, um, from working here, how is your concept of what this idea of experiencing homelessness is, has that changed for you? The more that you've been able to engage with people, or is it, or is it something you've had in that concept with lot?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've had that, I've, I've had a connection with, uh, with, with people of lower income, uh, or people who are struggling with homelessness for years. Uh, I've done it maybe for 10 years back in Toronto. Um, this is different. Every time is different. Every city is different. Every group of individuals is different.\n\nIt's never the same. Uh, I've served in Toronto for people who are on the streets or in shelters. I. Those were very different from people who came to the soup kitchen at church. Those were very different from people who [00:05:00] were of low income status that we used to, you know, go to their buildings and share meals with them.\n\nIn Mississauga, which is a suburb, a suburb of Toronto, very different people are coming here. You know, it's very surprising to me. People, people drive and come here, uh, or pick up their friend and come here or take the train and come here. Um, one thing that is definitely has been evident to me throughout the years is.\n\nNobody wants to be where they are and nobody's scary, which I think is an idea that, um, I had before. It's scary. I'm scared to talk to somebody who looks a bit different, who might twitch or might say something that I'm not comfortable with. Um, but I'm learning. The more I have the conversation, the the less scary it is and the more they're, you know, someone having a bad day.\n\nOr someone who've been having a bad day for so long. Hmm. Um, they're, they're just struggling with a bad day and a smile, a, Hey, how are you doing? [00:06:00] Talk about the weather. Talk about something that I really like doing 20 years ago, will take them in a flash in a to a happy place because I also have bad days.\n\nSpeaker: Totally. You know, it feels. Um, what's, what's your concept of orange sky? Do you know much about it and what do you think about it? I guess?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Uh, can you repeat, oh, sorry.\n\nSpeaker: Um, what's your concept of orange sky as a service and do you know much about it and\n\nSpeaker 2: what's not? So much? So my only exposure is walking in and walking out, uh, seeing that, uh, seeing, seeing the laundry, um, and what I know from people who should sit with me on the table.\n\nThey're very thankful, um, that somebody can take care of their laundry and not only take care of the laundry, but take care of them. Somebody who's gonna talk to them, somebody who's not gonna make them feel like they're, you know, they're their duty, but hey, uh, we're, we're here. We're doing laundry, we're talking, we're making friends.\n\nUm, fellowship is a strong word that we like to use. So having fellowship and not just a duty. I think [00:07:00] also I struggled that a lot for, for a long time, is. Serving as you know, I am here and you are there and I'm putting my hand down to help you. It doesn't feel so good. It is not, it doesn't build the other person.\n\nUm, and what I get from, you know, the, the, the gentleman and the, and the woman that I meet here is, that's not, that's not the attitude. The attitude is we're sitting together. There's no one is putting their hand down. We're sitting together. And that's very powerful.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. That's good. That's a really content.\n\nUm. What's this, what's this idea of story for you? So, the reason I'm doing this is Mm. Um, that we're gonna have lots of different people's telling their story. Yeah. Like what is our stories powerful and why, I guess, like, and, and why is it important to have a range of stories and not just a few?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a really good question.\n\nUm, I think. Uh, so I, I, I've been, uh, born [00:08:00] a Christian, lived a Christian my whole life. Um, I'm a believer and, uh, there's something very powerful about God choosing to speak through stories that says a lot when, when his choice, his defacto choice is a story that says something about the power of a story.\n\nUm, the Bible starts in a story, continues to have story upon story upon story, and tell the story of Christ himself and then the story of the church that we are living today. Um, stories are. Complicated or not complicated. They're complex. They have nuance. They're not bullet points. They're not, they're not flat.\n\nThey're 3D. They're full. They take you up and bring you down. You cry, you laugh. You, you, you feel something and, and you do not get stuck in a linear flat to the sequence of events. Mm-hmm. And. That, that that's what life is like. There's no, it's not linear, it's not flat. [00:09:00] There's so much happening. And when we tell stories, we're able to transport the person from where they are to being in the story.\n\nAnd that's so powerful. It's different from getting a bunch of stats or some information. Uh, it's, it's living something with somebody, which is very different than just getting information\n\nSpeaker: and what's like. I've, I'm definitely not a very good Christian. Um, I used to be good and I've read a lot of, I've read the Bible a few times.\n\nI even read it in Spanish. Um, what's like, and this whole, there's an idea of the word of God, I guess. Um, does that mean that he owns the, the words and the stories, do you think? Like, and, 'cause the reason I'm asking this is\n\nSpeaker 2: mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker: I'm really interested in like, who owns the story once you tell it. So if a friend or someone experiencing homelessness tells us a story and someone goes and [00:10:00] uses it, like, is that okay?\n\nAnd, and how do you, how do you do that properly, I guess is question.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great, that's a great question. I think\n\nSpeaker: about it a lot. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's, that's a great question and, and\n\nSpeaker: I think the reason I asked it was in relation to religion is that I feel like words are sacred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: And to me there's almost like a ownership in that.\n\nThere's like attribution,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker: So how do you do that for everyone, I guess, right? How do you, how do you allow people to attribute their own story,\n\nSpeaker 2: right? And have value that that's, those, those are some really, really big ideas. Really big ideas. Um,\n\nyou know, everything I've read and everything I've, I've, I've learned, uh, and I've come to, says that God very much involved people in writing his story. Um, he did not, you know, some other religions believe that, you know, somebody came and dictated exactly and the words were written. Everything I know about the Bible says that God did not do that.[00:11:00]\n\nThat God showed someone, someone something, whether it was a prophet or a king, or who, whoever was the writer, and then the person wrote what they saw in their own words. A very good example of that is, you know, the, the famous story of creation. That God created the heaven, the earth, and it was good. And then he created the animals and it was good.\n\nAnd then he created men. And it was very good, very unlikely that God was standing there and saying Very good. Most likely not. That's why Moses, this, these are Moses' words expressed to us. You know, everything was good, man was very good. God was very happy with man. The pinnacle, the crown of his creation.\n\nThose are the words of Moses. Those are not the words of God. But it's a story of God creating the world and humanity. So God, you know, the author and the owner of everything has no problem. And actually the delight in giving us, [00:12:00] uh, this, this like to become co-workers with him cot tellers of his story. So how much more, you know, should I allow my fellow human to do that if the creator allows us to do that with him?\n\nUm. That comes with a lot of responsibility. You don't wanna go and bash or ruin the story that someone gives you. And, and, you know, the, the church has a big history of those. We call these heretics. We're not very fond of these heretics. We took those stories and ruined them. Um, and, um, and, and so it should be with, you know, you telling me your story and then I'm going and twisting the story or giving it in the wrong light.\n\nSpeaker: Mm-hmm. It's a great frame. 'cause you know, one of the things I'm really interested in is if someone opens up their whole heart and tells their story and then someone goes and uses it and profits from it, or like, takes a bit of it and [00:13:00] spreads that part, but hides the other part. Mm-hmm. Um, it's almost like, um, you are devaluing that person's intelligence or experience.\n\nMm. And yeah. It's like a, yeah, something. I don't, I don't, I don't know how to solve or to work towards, but um, yeah, I feel like to be able to tell the whole story and then somehow make sure that you deliver the whole story is, is, is somewhat important. Um, and I know that like religion is one of those things that carries a lot of power and worth.\n\nAnd when those words are misconstrued, it can create some really damaging outcomes. Right. So. Yeah. It's, and it's the same with like, um, politics or like, um, yeah. Some of the stuff that happens with hate and things. I think it's, you're right. Words.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: Getting manipulated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think the beauty of religion, um, [00:14:00] at least Christianity, the one that I experienced the most is that I'm, I'm fortunate enough that I can connect with the source of the story.\n\nMm. Uh, I can connect with the author, I connect with God himself. Yeah. And then, you know, double check with him. That this is true. This is, this is what happened. This is what he intended to say. Or, or, or to ask us to do like wiki. Yeah. It is like a wiki. So we're also fortunate in the 21st century that we can go back and find the, the sources to a, to a degree.\n\nYou know, you can never perfectly find the source for everything. But we're, we're fortunate today that this can happen. You know, we're not living two, a hundred, 500 years ago. We know just because someone traveled, they can tell whatever they want, 'cause. How we're gonna go check something that happened, you know?\n\nYeah. 50 miles away.\n\nSpeaker: Go to the next town.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Different story. But today that's not the case anymore. So we're very fortunate that's the case. Uh, I think also puts an onus on each one of us to, when we read something, when we hear something, especially if it touches us. If it angers me, if it excites me, I should go and check.\n\nI should dig a little deeper [00:15:00] and, you know, seeing a source behind the story should gives me more confidence versus seeing something that, you know, is a. I don't know. 15 second TikTok. Yeah. And then I don't know what to make of that.\n\nSpeaker: Uh, I think we, this bloke might have ended our storytelling. The motorbike\n\nSpeaker 2: don't\n\nSpeaker: go perfect.\n\nNo, it's perfect timing. That's awesome, man. Thank you. Thanks man.

Um, it's, it's not so [00:01:00] much that I'm starving hungry, but, um, it's nice to get out and have a good clean cunt meal. Most of these persons I've known for a long time, and, uh, Steve, who runs the establishment, I've known him for.\n\nOh, 25 plus years and I appreciate that they've got some fruit and veggies to take home. 'cause everything helps. And over the years I've spoken to people and we've laughed, we've cried. We are giggled, we are screamed, we've yelled, we're everything. And it's just nice to come out and meet people. Um. Some of them are around my age, some are younger and that, but not everyone's fortunate to be able to drive down.\n\nSome of them are homeless, but I've never seen any major problems [00:02:00] down here. And if there is, it would be NI in the bud. Very quick. There's no alcohol and there's no smoking on the premises. And people, well, they just respect. And they're just grateful and we just, you know, laugh and just talk about things and it's great and there's always plenty to go around.\n\nSpeaker 6: Tell us a little bit about Orange Sky and what, what sort of you, what do you feel about their presence here? Or what, what do you think about Orange Sky?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I feel safe and, uh, there is a police station close by, but. Uh, to my knowledge, they've never had to come. Uh, it's very handy for people that don't live in the immediate area because the train is within walking distance.\n\nI believe there are buses that come into the area to help people, and I think it's just [00:03:00] nice.\n\nSpeaker 6: And what do you think about Orange Guy?\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh, I appreciate it because there's been times when I've got behind with the washing and I've only got a small washing machine. And these gorgeous ladies and Jens, they'll take anything.\n\nAnd not only that, they'll dry it and they'll fold it for you all with a smile.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. And what about like the, just the people too? What do you think about the people and the service?\n\nSpeaker 5: The people are good. They're good, they're friendly. I'm not very good on names, but you know, I just say, hi, darl, how you going?\n\nHi sweetie. Or, or whatever. And sometimes people give you a kiss and a hug. Sometimes people are upset and they need to talk to someone. I'm not saying I understand everything or that I can help everyone, but it's nice to just have a little talk. Mm mm And, and [00:04:00] some people, not for me to say, they come down and you can tell they've had the same t-shirt on for a month.\n\nMm. Not my business. Mm. There was a service that where you could actually have a shower here, lot like, um. I think there was two or three showers, a caravan type thing, and I thought that was lovely. And whilst you're having a shower, oh, free soap and towel, bit of the old shampoo. Mm. Then you could, um, you know, if you were really desperate, someone finds you clean clothing, believe me.\n\nMm. It's very kind. And then whilst your clothing and yourself are being freshened up, you can go and have a lovely meal.\n\nSpeaker 6: Why do you think these types of, um, meals and services are important in the community?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, as I said, there's people that, [00:05:00] um, they just, well, not everyone, but you see them sitting on the streets so lonely and so depressed, and nobody will talk to them because as I said, the same t-shirt for a month.\n\nAnd you don't know their situation. Not everyone is drugs and alcohol. Mm-hmm. Bear in mind, a few may have a mental health, which is made worse by being on the street. Mm-hmm. Because there's, there's not really anyone around to help. I've seen it in the city. They've just walked past and what's a couple of dollars?\n\nThey could get some cool water. A nice sandwich. Mm.\n\nSpeaker 6: And how would you describe your own sort of experience over the last little while? Like, is that, like, how would you explain to people your own situation, scenario, and story?\n\nSpeaker 5: My living [00:06:00] situation? Mm, yes. Um, I'm now divorced. Um, I am, I'm in a ministry of Housing house, home house.\n\nUm, I've been there for 26 years. Um, I'm a mother of five. They've all left home of course, and um, unfortunately they've got themselves because I pushed very hard for education and they've got themselves some very good jobs and they forget that they've come from me and mild background. Mm. And the money that they receive each week has gone to their heads and they see me as just a thing.\n\nMm. I find it, sorry, I find it very hard. Um, I see it as borderline, um, a abuse. Mm. And [00:07:00] I have my youngest son I have not seen for three and a half years. Um, he. He's on alcohol. He was living with me after his divorce and alcohol causes temper. I believe I'm allowed to say to him, behave yourself, and if you don't, you're out the door.\n\nIt escalated. The rest is private. It was a police matter.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm-hmm. What's the, um, what's the opportunity to. I suppose, yeah. You've been talking about this place and what's the opportunity to create new community and new people here? Do you know what I mean? Like is that something that you are working to do and is this something that's helpful for you?\n\nSpeaker 5: Do think? Well, look over the years I, I've been coming here, as I said, several years over, over the years I've noticed, and as recently as 18 months [00:08:00] ago, a lot of. Uh, places similar to this that were offering meals. Mm. They've just run out of funding and they've closed down, et cetera. Right. And as a result,\n\nSpeaker 6: sorry, there's a nice photo.\n\nSpeaker 5: And as a result, a lot of them, uh, have heard about this place through word of mouth and they've just drifted across here and it's nothing as Steve is extremely generous. And it's nothing for a hundred plus people to turn up at two separate settings on Christmas for a meal and a little bit of happiness, laughter, a generous with the present and a nice box of food to help you through the Christmas break.\n\nAnd for miles around, this is the only place where you can get a good quality meal. And they, [00:09:00] they have soup in the wintertime as well as the meal. Mm-hmm. And you can take food away and people are grateful for that. And it's good food that you can eat. Um, a lot of people don't have cooking devices because they're, uh, maybe sleeping in the car or something like that.\n\nThey can come here, get a nice full belly, and they'll sleep well that night.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. So amazing. What, what do you think, what do you think the general community could learn from these types of communities and people helping each other? Like, do you think that this is something that is unique and like, how do, how do people, you said it before, like, I think money gets to people's heads sometimes and they forget how to help people.\n\nYes, it's true. It's true. How do we, how do we talk about these places that other people sort of, these\n\nSpeaker 5: people are on the same level as me? Just be grateful. Today, [00:10:00] there was very little on the takeaway table, as in fruit and veggies. I was offered more and I looked around, there was people behind me and I said, look, I'm taking what I can fit in my fridge and what I can eat.\n\nMm, okay. I will make way. It's the way it is. And the people in there, they're not greedy. And if they appear greedy, it's just, they've come from different backgrounds. Some of them have been in jail.\n\nSpeaker 7: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: And you don't talk, you just eat your meal and you guard your meal. Mm. Because that's the, the situation that they may have come from.\n\nMm. So you, you, you, you don't judge them how they eat or what they put in their pocket because no one's going to say, put it back. No one.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm. Alright. I could talk all day, but I think we need to like find some other [00:11:00] people. Well,\n\nSpeaker 5: I'm just grateful and there are occasions when Steve gets in a hairdresser free.\n\nAnd he also gets in a masseur free and people love it. Yeah, that sounds amazing. Yes. Yes. And it's so good. All right, I'm gonna take a photo. Okay. Okay. Get my good side. I'll, I'll take, I'll take that mic off first.\n\nSpeaker 6: Oh,\n\nSpeaker 5: just in the shot.\n\nSpeaker 6: Did\n\nSpeaker 5: I say too much?\n\nSpeaker 6: You said an amazing amount. It's true. Yes.\n\nAre you?\n\nOh, I'm way too bright. One sec. It's, this is my fault. Okay.\n\nHow about one you sit up a little bit more and Oh, that's, oh, that's awesome. Okay, great. Amazing.

I've yeah, done a fair bit of work at, people who have been incarcerated and especially young people and stuff.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eYeah. How would you explain that experience from going into coming out? How would I explain it? It's not my first time I've been in jail. I'm like one of the older groups in jail now. It's horrible place, but everyone ends up there for a reason, it's a horrible place.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eThat's what I wanna say, mate. But usually, yeah, people that are in there for a reason and yeah. Avoid it at all costs. Yeah. The petty bullshit that people do to get themselves in there isn't really worth at the end of the day. You \u003c�span style=\"color:#808080\"\u003e[00:03:00]\u003c�/span\u003e can earn a lot more in one day's work that you can from stealing or robbing or whatever, whatever you've done wrong to get in there.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eAnd what about that transition out period? Transition out period? So this is what I found hard. While I knew I was getting out, I had a sentence date. I knew what was coming up and that, and I had about two months to go left on the sentence, and I was trying to ring around and find a place to go because I'd been staying with my mother before this.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eBut she's a bad drug user. I was doing really well and she sold everything I had. I had nothing to go back to. So I was trying to find places, for example, caravan, parks everywhere. We don't have too many resources in jail, so a lot of it was through social workers or just getting my mates to inquire about caravan parks and stuff like that.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eAnd that's just as much as the house these days at caravan park per week. Even just a tent bloody thing in the Cameron Park. Too much. And so basically I got let out with no place to go stay and. That wasn't \u003c�span style=\"color:#808080\"\u003e[00:04:00]\u003c�/span\u003e a good start, like struggled there for ages. Don't get along with a lot of my family.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eThey've got their own things going on too. I don't like treating on people as well, so yeah, not having anything to come out to like that was my biggest worry, yeah. Then I just had to make do mate. How do you think or did you ever experience as a young person or how do you think that affects young people who go through that detention system?\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eI don't think young people should. My brother as a juvenile did a lot of juvenile jail, spent a, all his juvenile, he's still in jail to this day. He is 35 and probably done 30. Not.

When she had a child, she had 75 percent brain damage. It took 10 years to get to walk and talk, but she tried and tried every day to get better.\n\nIt's called, the book is called, Waiting for the Sunshine, One Day at a Time.\n\nSpeaker 11: Tell me a little bit more about yourself.\n\nDavid: Ah, yeah, I don't know what to say. I was born in England and then we [00:01:00] found that we couldn't get on in England so Jeannie and I was caught in and we decided we'd come to Australia. She put in for Australia first and got permission to come before I could.\n\nSo she got on a big ocean liner and came all the way across the world on her own, just for me. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 10: Wow.\n\nWow.\n\nDavid: So when she was having a child, things went wrong. Obviously I must stand by her because, as I said, she came all the way across the world for me. And then, when she was sick, she had the child, she had 75 percent brain damage, which was caused.\n\nToday, they've got a name for it. It's called a clampsia today. In those earlier days, we didn't know what to call it. But they nursed her and looked [00:02:00] after her at the Hamilton Hospital, which saved her life. It was impossible to believe. How many people came to help me?\n\nSpeaker 11: What's it like having people to help?\n\nWhat does that feel like? Oh,\n\nDavid: it's phenomenal. In those days, you just couldn't believe the kind of help and people that came. It was tremendous. One lady had five children, two adopted children, and offered to take care of Jean's baby for 14 months. I said, because Jean was that ill, she couldn't look after the child at all.\n\nYeah. And so many people helped me along the way, it was unbelievable.\n\nSpeaker 11: Have you ever used the Orange Sky for washing?\n\nDavid: Yes, I have. What do you\n\nSpeaker 11: think of Orange Sky?\n\nDavid: Oh, I think it's a terrific idea. Especially nowadays that things are getting tough. And you need somewhere to bring it to. If [00:03:00] you're sleeping in your car, or anywhere, sleeping about, you need to be able to bring everything down to get washed and cleaned.\n\nAnd these meals that's out and about is tremendous. We really couldn't do without them. What's it\n\nSpeaker 11: Having people to talk to and having a community? What's it like having people to talk to and a community? Yeah,\n\nDavid: Of course, we come round these places. To meet people and talk with them and keep you associated with what's going on and around you.\n\nMakes a big difference, yeah. Oh yeah, you'd be terribly lonely and stuck if you were just at home on your own and not able to get out and see these people. Yeah, absolutely. But it's surprising how many of them you meet in so many different places, all the same situation. Oh yeah, it's terrific.\n\nSpeaker 11: Do you get to talk to lots of different people here?\n\nDo they have lots of different stories [00:04:00] and experiences? Oh yes,\n\nDavid: everybody that comes to these. Food, places, or meals. Of course they have different stories and have worked different ways in life. I said, and then found myself completely stuck because I said it's changed now. If you haven't got it, you will never be able to get it at the moment in Australia.\n\nIt's just got beyond the working man to be able to afford to live.\n\nSpeaker 11: Yeah. And,\n\nWhat's what are some things next for you? I've got some, tell me more about the book and like what you're doing with it.\n\nDavid: Yeah, with the book it encourages people that Say they've lost their job, they've got two or three children, the bank's knocking on the door for the house, and they're going to lose their house or their car.\n\nThe book encourages them to show what you can get through as long as you've got your partner and stay together. There's nothing like having reasonable good health, [00:05:00] your partner and your family. Nothing else matters. The house and the car doesn't even matter at all. What difference does it make? You lose the house but as long as you've got your family and your partner then you've got everything.\n\nSpeaker 11: I'm really interested in stories. What do you, and you've obviously written a book. Why do you think stories are important and why do you think books are important? I\n\nDavid: think the story is so important in the book because it encourages people to stay together and to be able to get through tough times.\n\nAs I said, Jeannie was so ill, it took 10 years to get her to walk and talk. It took 30 years for, to try and run a home. I said, but that's the why the story is really going very well. It, for these times when things are tough and you're struggling so much, it really helps you with the [00:06:00] family and stay together.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: If you were to tell someone why they should buy the book, this is your chance, why should people buy the book?\n\nDavid: They'll never remember or they won't have nothing left from their legacy or their entire life of struggling or the way they've gone through life. So if you can write a book about your life, how you started, how you found your partner and how you progressed and struggled through life, this is why you need to write a book.\n\nBecause you won't have a legacy to leave behind unless you've got a book of your life story.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what do you hope happens with the book? What do you hope is the outcome\n\nDavid: of it? We're hoping that it'll help a lot of people that's struggling. And there's so many people came to me and said, Oh look, you've wrote a book.\n\nfor sharing the book with me. Because she'd got three [00:07:00] children and was losing the house to the bank. And she was in tears when she thanked me for sharing the story. I said, this is what the story's about. It's to try and get people to stay together. And be together, I said, this is a, this is what it's about, it's to get you through tough times, when you think you're struggling and having bad times, you can understand how, if you stay together, you can get through it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: And what's where are you going back to tonight? Where are you staying, and what's that like?\n\nDavid: Pardon?\n\nSpeaker 11: Where are you staying\n\nDavid: at the moment? Oh, I've got my own house. So I'll be going home to my house. But of course I'm on my own now, so it makes an awful difference. Without coming round for these meals and coming to these places, oh, it's such a hard time staying and living on your own.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 11: It was amazing to hear your [00:08:00] story. I'm going to buy one of your books. Yes. On Amazon? Buy it on Amazon?\n\nDavid: Yes, buy it from Amazon.\n\nSpeaker 11: Amazing.\n\nDavid: Yes. Cool. You will thoroughly enjoy it, and you'll be amazed on how many people. Like the story because it gets them to stay together and none of this family violence and all that.\n\nJust please understand that you've met together in the first place because you wanted to.

Um, it's, it's not so [00:01:00] much that I'm starving hungry, but, um, it's nice to get out and have a good clean cunt meal. Most of these persons I've known for a long time, and, uh, Steve, who runs the establishment, I've known him for.\n\nOh, 25 plus years and I appreciate that they've got some fruit and veggies to take home. 'cause everything helps. And over the years I've spoken to people and we've laughed, we've cried. We are giggled, we are screamed, we've yelled, we're everything. And it's just nice to come out and meet people. Um. Some of them are around my age, some are younger and that, but not everyone's fortunate to be able to drive down.\n\nSome of them are homeless, but I've never seen any major problems [00:02:00] down here. And if there is, it would be NI in the bud. Very quick. There's no alcohol and there's no smoking on the premises. And people, well, they just respect. And they're just grateful and we just, you know, laugh and just talk about things and it's great and there's always plenty to go around.\n\nSpeaker 6: Tell us a little bit about Orange Sky and what, what sort of you, what do you feel about their presence here? Or what, what do you think about Orange Sky?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, I feel safe and, uh, there is a police station close by, but. Uh, to my knowledge, they've never had to come. Uh, it's very handy for people that don't live in the immediate area because the train is within walking distance.\n\nI believe there are buses that come into the area to help people, and I think it's just [00:03:00] nice.\n\nSpeaker 6: And what do you think about Orange Guy?\n\nSpeaker 5: Oh, I appreciate it because there's been times when I've got behind with the washing and I've only got a small washing machine. And these gorgeous ladies and Jens, they'll take anything.\n\nAnd not only that, they'll dry it and they'll fold it for you all with a smile.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. And what about like the, just the people too? What do you think about the people and the service?\n\nSpeaker 5: The people are good. They're good, they're friendly. I'm not very good on names, but you know, I just say, hi, darl, how you going?\n\nHi sweetie. Or, or whatever. And sometimes people give you a kiss and a hug. Sometimes people are upset and they need to talk to someone. I'm not saying I understand everything or that I can help everyone, but it's nice to just have a little talk. Mm mm And, and [00:04:00] some people, not for me to say, they come down and you can tell they've had the same t-shirt on for a month.\n\nMm. Not my business. Mm. There was a service that where you could actually have a shower here, lot like, um. I think there was two or three showers, a caravan type thing, and I thought that was lovely. And whilst you're having a shower, oh, free soap and towel, bit of the old shampoo. Mm. Then you could, um, you know, if you were really desperate, someone finds you clean clothing, believe me.\n\nMm. It's very kind. And then whilst your clothing and yourself are being freshened up, you can go and have a lovely meal.\n\nSpeaker 6: Why do you think these types of, um, meals and services are important in the community?\n\nSpeaker 5: Well, as I said, there's people that, [00:05:00] um, they just, well, not everyone, but you see them sitting on the streets so lonely and so depressed, and nobody will talk to them because as I said, the same t-shirt for a month.\n\nAnd you don't know their situation. Not everyone is drugs and alcohol. Mm-hmm. Bear in mind, a few may have a mental health, which is made worse by being on the street. Mm-hmm. Because there's, there's not really anyone around to help. I've seen it in the city. They've just walked past and what's a couple of dollars?\n\nThey could get some cool water. A nice sandwich. Mm.\n\nSpeaker 6: And how would you describe your own sort of experience over the last little while? Like, is that, like, how would you explain to people your own situation, scenario, and story?\n\nSpeaker 5: My living [00:06:00] situation? Mm, yes. Um, I'm now divorced. Um, I am, I'm in a ministry of Housing house, home house.\n\nUm, I've been there for 26 years. Um, I'm a mother of five. They've all left home of course, and um, unfortunately they've got themselves because I pushed very hard for education and they've got themselves some very good jobs and they forget that they've come from me and mild background. Mm. And the money that they receive each week has gone to their heads and they see me as just a thing.\n\nMm. I find it, sorry, I find it very hard. Um, I see it as borderline, um, a abuse. Mm. And [00:07:00] I have my youngest son I have not seen for three and a half years. Um, he. He's on alcohol. He was living with me after his divorce and alcohol causes temper. I believe I'm allowed to say to him, behave yourself, and if you don't, you're out the door.\n\nIt escalated. The rest is private. It was a police matter.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm-hmm. What's the, um, what's the opportunity to. I suppose, yeah. You've been talking about this place and what's the opportunity to create new community and new people here? Do you know what I mean? Like is that something that you are working to do and is this something that's helpful for you?\n\nSpeaker 5: Do think? Well, look over the years I, I've been coming here, as I said, several years over, over the years I've noticed, and as recently as 18 months [00:08:00] ago, a lot of. Uh, places similar to this that were offering meals. Mm. They've just run out of funding and they've closed down, et cetera. Right. And as a result,\n\nSpeaker 6: sorry, there's a nice photo.\n\nSpeaker 5: And as a result, a lot of them, uh, have heard about this place through word of mouth and they've just drifted across here and it's nothing as Steve is extremely generous. And it's nothing for a hundred plus people to turn up at two separate settings on Christmas for a meal and a little bit of happiness, laughter, a generous with the present and a nice box of food to help you through the Christmas break.\n\nAnd for miles around, this is the only place where you can get a good quality meal. And they, [00:09:00] they have soup in the wintertime as well as the meal. Mm-hmm. And you can take food away and people are grateful for that. And it's good food that you can eat. Um, a lot of people don't have cooking devices because they're, uh, maybe sleeping in the car or something like that.\n\nThey can come here, get a nice full belly, and they'll sleep well that night.\n\nSpeaker 6: Wow. So amazing. What, what do you think, what do you think the general community could learn from these types of communities and people helping each other? Like, do you think that this is something that is unique and like, how do, how do people, you said it before, like, I think money gets to people's heads sometimes and they forget how to help people.\n\nYes, it's true. It's true. How do we, how do we talk about these places that other people sort of, these\n\nSpeaker 5: people are on the same level as me? Just be grateful. Today, [00:10:00] there was very little on the takeaway table, as in fruit and veggies. I was offered more and I looked around, there was people behind me and I said, look, I'm taking what I can fit in my fridge and what I can eat.\n\nMm, okay. I will make way. It's the way it is. And the people in there, they're not greedy. And if they appear greedy, it's just, they've come from different backgrounds. Some of them have been in jail.\n\nSpeaker 7: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 5: And you don't talk, you just eat your meal and you guard your meal. Mm. Because that's the, the situation that they may have come from.\n\nMm. So you, you, you, you don't judge them how they eat or what they put in their pocket because no one's going to say, put it back. No one.\n\nSpeaker 6: Mm. Alright. I could talk all day, but I think we need to like find some other [00:11:00] people. Well,\n\nSpeaker 5: I'm just grateful and there are occasions when Steve gets in a hairdresser free.\n\nAnd he also gets in a masseur free and people love it. Yeah, that sounds amazing. Yes. Yes. And it's so good. All right, I'm gonna take a photo. Okay. Okay. Get my good side. I'll, I'll take, I'll take that mic off first.\n\nSpeaker 6: Oh,\n\nSpeaker 5: just in the shot.\n\nSpeaker 6: Did\n\nSpeaker 5: I say too much?\n\nSpeaker 6: You said an amazing amount. It's true. Yes.\n\nAre you?\n\nOh, I'm way too bright. One sec. It's, this is my fault. Okay.\n\nHow about one you sit up a little bit more and Oh, that's, oh, that's awesome. Okay, great. Amazing.

It's Bridget Perry, B-R-I-G-I-T-P-E-R-R-Y. go@outlook.com.\n\nAlright.\n\nI grew up in Northern California in Sonoma County wine country, and I lived there for most of my life. I met my now husband online in 2002 before it was cool. He likes to say, oh, cool. 2001 actually. And we got married in 2011 and I moved.\n\nHere to [00:01:00] Canberra. My husband grew up here in Canberra. I lived here his whole life. So I moved here and I've been here ever since. It's just a little bit about me. When did you first hear about Orange Sky? When Nick and Lucas won Young Australian of the Year. Wow. Yeah, I love watching Young Australian, or I love watching Australia the year.\n\nI love hearing everybody's stories. I always have had a big piece of my heart in charity work, and I love that people are creative in the ways that they can give to a community and the innovation that people do for things. And I thought, oh my gosh, a mobile laundry service. How? Totally brilliant. What a great, amazing idea.\n\nSo I was really impressed. And when they came to Canberra and they were looking for volunteers, I signed up immediately. I said, I want in on that.\n\nI think mostly it's just [00:02:00] because of the way that I was raised. I was raised by very giving generous parents, and I grew up in a church that was very loving and it was always about taking care of people in your community and people around you. And I also for a while, worked with kids in out-of-home care and one of my housemates she worked for.\n\nA women's shelter and it's just like a, an awareness that there are people in your community that need help.\n\nOrange sky has done such a good job of taking that stigma out of it and saying, this is a person and this person has a name, and this person has a story. And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking [00:03:00] to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things. And it's really nice to be able to share with them why I do it and why it's important to take care of people, even if they're people that you don't know.\n\nIt's no secret. I tell everyone that I volunteer and, i've made it known to a lot of people. I've done the Sudsy challenge a few times. I like having those conversations and telling people this, there's more to life than just doing what you do. It's about giving back to your community.\n\nIn the beginning it was really cool to be like, oh, a mobile laundry service.\n\nBut then to have seen things [00:04:00] evolve over time and then to say it's not just about laundry. It's about letting people. Be heard, and people who are homeless often go all day without talking to anyone. So to have a place for people to come and talk to people, that's huge. That's a huge connection point that people are missing.\n\nAnd to make that realization in the process of, oh, we're doing something great by washing people's clothes. Oh, but also there's an added benefit to it that might even be more important.\n\nA lot of conversation is waiting for your turn to talk. You say something, I think of something to say in response, but sometimes people just want to be listened to and you don't have to say anything in response.\n\nYou could just listen. And that makes it very validating for that person to just have somebody listening and go, oh, really? Oh, that's what's [00:05:00] going on for you? Oh, that must be hard, or That must be nice. Or whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. The more I do this stuff, the more I realize, like stories are very broad.\n\nIn my in my Orange Sky world, I have been trying to push that. Volunteers in Canberra need alcohol and other drug harm reduction training. I think that's really important for volunteers here. Because of the decriminalization of personalized or drugs for personalized use. And I think that there are a lot of times that people on shift, especially at night encounter people who are using drugs or are on drugs at the time that they come to shift.\n\nAnd if there was an overdose, would volunteers know how to do something about that or. [00:06:00] If they notice somebody's on drugs, is there a way to feel more comfortable and not be just immediately scared and think, oh no, that's a scary drug addict. Like they're people too. They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and [00:07:00] thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\nWhen I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money? And she's you can give all the money in the world, but if there's nobody willing to. Do the time on the shift, then what's the point?\n\nYou have to have somebody doing the work. And that's what I like to tell my kids. Like it's not just about what you can give money to, 'cause that's important also, but it's about being there, being the hands, making it work. Otherwise it falls apart. Yeah. Yeah. Make us are very good at [00:08:00] trying to. Dumb down the impact of one part of the organization and being like, everyone lifts it, right?\n\nWhether it's a little kid giving five bucks to volunteer volunteers or yeah.

Finally got my Visa last year, May 2nd, 2024. That was 16 days before my birthday, and it was a blessing year. And now I've been living in.\n\nAustralia for six months or something now. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's life been like for you, I guess for the last little bit in Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh, I think Australia is the most beautiful country in the world, and I think Melbourne. Yeah, definitely is a beautiful place. Yeah, I've been in two places only that's in.\n\nDanon and Brook, the Sunshine Victoria in Melbourne. And I like it. Yeah, [00:01:00] I like both places. Yeah. But I became homeless just seven weeks ago seven months ago. So yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's that experience been like for you?\n\nSpeaker 12: It's been challenging and I think it's rewarding too at the same time because I learned a lot of things I lost a lot too.\n\nBut there's a challenging part is losing a lot of friends. You are losing trust in everybody, especially the government. And then you tend to wanna blame and point fingers at, others. But at the end of the day, I think everybody deserves a place to sleep, place access to, water and electricity.\n\nAnd as for me, as a refugee. [00:02:00] Who seek for asylum in here. And I came and I got, they gave me asylum. I think these rights, I have to acknowledge that I need to make myself work harder to find another accommodation for myself. So I have a, shelter and. Electricity, water and all this.\n\nYeah. Otherwise, I'm not a human being, I cannot, I have to work harder to do this. Yeah. To find a house to live in. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, it's all right.\n\nSpeaker 13: What was life like in, in Fiji before you came?\n\nSpeaker 12: Life was very hard. I think it's harder than. It is very difficult, harder than what I've harder than what I've experienced in my life in here.\n\nBut I've seen other people in here [00:03:00] too who are homeless who I think they face it harder than even in my country. I think my country is easier. In here, it's very difficult because it's twofold. You can see the good and the bad, but that's advantage and disadvantage from me leaving my country and from me living in here.\n\nLike in my country, you don't look at the clock. You don't really be punctual in Australia it is different. It's very difficult because the homeless people and all this, they're struggling because why they have to be punctual and pay fees and all these things and all, especially when they don't have job and all this is more difficult.\n\nYeah. But in my country, the only thing is the violence is the scary part. Yeah. The violence is, yeah. [00:04:00] There's no limit. That's the thing. So it's extreme violence. Yeah. So\n\nSpeaker 13: what made you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Since we got my country got independence from Australia in 1975. After that, only like my parents. They're like citizens of Australia because they were born before we got independence, but they don't get recognized for that. They haven't got a, their citizenship or anything for me. Yes. I was born after 1975. I can get a, I can't get a, passport and all this fight for my rights to come here, but that wasn't the case.\n\nMy parents fight for the right to come here too, and then I fight for my right to come here. It doesn't make sense to me. It is no common sense, but it's all right. God put the law in for some reason. I don't know. We'll work it out later, but I think it's not right. It's not right because if you are born in a country while it's still Australia, [00:05:00] you are a citizen of Australia automatically.\n\nAnd I thought it was only my parents, but I find that, half of the Korean mob and the Torres Strait Islander mob and all the ma everybody, most of the aboriginals, they don't have the citizenship too. So I think we are all in the same boat. So there's nothing to, what was the question again?\n\nSpeaker 13: Why did you come to Australia?\n\nSpeaker 12: Oh yeah. Why I came to Australia? Yeah, because I know this this. My mother country, this is my homeland. This is my mother country, so I still have right to come here. But I didn't come. All my family and everybody, they came here before maybe 1997. Even, I don't know if I were, when I was younger, I came, I don't know.\n\nI can't remember because a lot of traveling. Around the country within PNG and here too, but I can't remember most of [00:06:00] it when I was younger. I only, the only thing I can remember is from 1993 up, when I started going to school. Yeah. After that there were a lot of tribal conflicts in my village.\n\nYeah. Yeah. So my parents have been like, they're basically like vol, voluntary workers. They're born again Christians. My father was a heavy diesel equipment fitter, and my mother was a principal at one of the secondary high schools in p and g, and then she became a community office officer for the mining company in my country.\n\nYeah. And she got some more degrees on top of her teaching and all this, and she. Yeah, she's basically the breadwinner of my family.\n\nAs a result, inherited a lot of land [00:07:00] back at home because most of my family, they come and grow up here, so my sister and my brother, and my mother's sister. So because of my land titles, my life is in danger. Because I received land royalties. Yeah. So they want to kill me. I had to take myself out of my country.\n\nYeah. Yeah. I'm the first born in my male in my country. In my family. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the situation daily for you in Australia now? What's the main things in which you're working on or working towards, or what do you do today?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah the first thing I'm working on is basically to get to know the people.\n\nKnow the system here, the street, the bus service is very difficult because if you grow up here, you can instinctively make decisions like what to do, where to go, what number to go. It is not like that. Every day I wake up to check the number again, [00:08:00] because I'm not sure which bus I'm getting on.\n\nAnd I keep on asking the traffic officers and all this, and the people here are very helpful and very, I think Australia is Australian and the community in Melbourne especially, they're good people. They help a lot. Yeah. And\n\nSpeaker 13: Are you using the Sky Service? What do you think of Orange Sky and what they're doing?\n\nSpeaker 12: I think orange sky, I've seen it where in, on TV and all this. And I think I really appreciate the work they do and yeah, I highly recommend the people who fund and support these services. Yeah. God bless you all, like you, you got a heart, heart of gold and I really appreciate your support for the sky orange. People, I'd like to be a volunteer too, to help wash the clothes for like this, but I'm not sure how it's gonna work because that's the only thing. I have. The trolley, if you can take the picture there it [00:09:00] is. Just the trolley there. Yeah.\n\nThat's my only problem because\n\nI never been in Australia, homeless in winter, but summer is all right. That's why I take a lot of clothes there in there. Okay.\n\nSpeaker 13: And what's why do you think like this idea of connection and being able to talk to people is important?\n\nThat's part of what Orange sky does. Why is, why do humans need other people and other people to talk to?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think because it's very lonely world for me. For me, I think I'm lonely. I'm lonely maybe because. I enjoy other things and all this. Maybe I'm not I don't have a partner, that's why I'm lonely or something.\n\nBut I'm straight just for information looking for a girl. I have some of my partner ex-partners back in p and g, but since I come here, I have to start a new life, but it's very difficult for me. I can't get over it. Yeah. Like starting a new life here. Yeah. Yeah, I still have [00:10:00] my family back at home.\n\nYeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's like some things in which you do to connect with people in Australia\n\nSpeaker 12: In Australia, basically, I just most of the time I just say hello to people, meet them on the road. But sometimes I drink drink alcohol once in a while, and when I drink, I feel more open to speak to people and yeah, I meet a lot of people here.\n\nYeah. Yeah. But\n\nSpeaker 13: do you meet a lot of other people that are not from Australia and do you connect in that way as well or do you make most\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah, I meet a lot of people not from Australia and Yeah. But I'm very curious about the, how the real Australian, like how the Australians are. The culture and all this, how they speak and all this.\n\nI try to follow, learn the accent, the lingo. But I think if they speak in the ling the slangs I don't understand. They, I seen a lot of, when they get to the, they start using [00:11:00] the slangs and all this, they know. Yeah. And it's a different level. Yeah. Yeah. I can't read it, but I understand.\n\nYeah, I understand. That's cool.\n\nSpeaker 13: What's the next sort of steps for you? What do you wanna do next?\n\nSpeaker 12: The next step for me is after I understand the system, I'm gonna be like, five years. Five years I won't work because that's, I promise that already, because five years, actually seven years I fight for my visa, and finally after seven years, I got it.\n\nSo seven years I will stay. I am like a, a baby, newborn baby. I'm still growing. When I become seven years old, I will understand what to do and then I will start working there.\n\nYeah. I will start working after seven years, but now I'm so mentally tormented because I've been institutionalized and I tried working.\n\nI was working with the [00:12:00] brick laying and all these things. I just walk one day. Yeah. But I couldn't I'm a process technician. Even just fixing a bicycle. I can't do it. I try to change the wheel, change that tube. I can't do it because I can't concentrate. It takes like over two to three hours just changing the tire.\n\nSo I've been mentally affected too. Yeah. I got stabbed here. Two times here. Two times here, two times here. I'm a victim of one punch coward assault. Yeah. They punched me here too. And I fell down. Actually I was on the balcony and they punched me and I fell down because I was dead drunk, so I fell down and the cement broke my jaw.\n\nI got four screws here. Four screws. Yeah. Yes. From my fractured jaw. And then I got hit by a, I got hit by a [00:13:00] car. It's like it was lady, she stopped by the traffic light. I was coming on a bike trying to go and do a inspection. House inspection. Yeah. I come and then there was green light was on. And then she stopped.\n\nAll the cars went and she stopped. And so I took off. When I took off, she took off again and she hit me again. And then she hit me. I went to the air five meters up, landed on my head, bro. Yeah, to my ligament, spine, ligament. And then what happened was the police come to question me, take me to the hospital in all.\n\nI said no, it's all right. It's not her because she was a Muslim lady. She just pick her children and she was crying too. So I feel sorry. Like I said, no she didn't do anything. And then I woke up and I went to the hospital myself. Yeah. And that's another that's the third incident I got.[00:14:00]\n\nSo I got a lot of injuries when I came to Australia too. Yeah. Yeah. What's, what other\n\nSpeaker 13: services do you use at the moment? What are the types of things in which,\n\nSpeaker 12: I use the sender link. I use the Salvation Army, I use the library for shower, and whenever I want to do a like con. Do internet, like search some things.\n\nFree wifi. I go to the library. I even use the console wifi sometimes when I don't have data. What else do I use? I use the bus services and the train services. Most of the times I don't have the, my key, but I think the officers I used to miss understand. But they're really there to help me. Yeah.\n\nI think. Yeah. Yeah. What,\n\nSpeaker 13: and what other things do you think would be helpful for you if someone was to be able to support? What are Yeah. Are most [00:15:00] important?\n\nSpeaker 12: Yeah. I think I would need support to, at least get a job. I really need support to get a job and a house like I'm mentally affected.\n\nI had a mental, independent, psych mental health psych assessment by a doctor, and he found out that I was mentally impaired and he is put a no enough in claim for my compensation. And he says, admit that, but I don't want the money because I don't know how to budget because mentally affected, I can't even work.\n\nBecause I get paranoid, I don't trust anybody. I don't even trust myself. The only thing I trust is I'm praying to God every night or something to gimme some, yeah. But yeah, sometimes I go crazy. Yeah, I try to take things in my own hands, but in my heart I know what is against my religion and I try not to do it.\n\nDo [00:16:00] it a lot, get angry at someone or get violent or something like that is no good. And I'm trying to learn how to live here. Yeah. But it's overwhelming because the culture shock. Yeah. Yeah. But I think it'll be all good. Yeah. Thanks to people like you and the Orange Sky team and all this, I think we are blessed to have, people who do this work and who support us like this. Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Yeah. Awesome.\n\nSpeaker 14: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker 13: Done.\n\nSpeaker 14: Yeah. All right.

I live on the streets. I've been, yeah, I've been staying in tents. I've been staying at shelter and in hostels for the past two years. It's an adventure.\n\nOrange Sky's great. They're really helpful because just the practical things whilst your houseless, like trying to do your laundry can be a challenge. So the fact that you guys come out to the locations.\n\nNear day space and near the Uniting Church. That's where people get free food. For those who don't know, it's really helpful. It's really helpful just being able to do your laundry whilst you're doing everything else in the day. It's just, it's one more thing that we don't have to worry about. So it's appreciated and volunteers and connection and communication and stuff.\n\n[00:01:00] If isolation is like the struggle of modern society, then connection to communities, the antidote.\n\nI think it's practical. It's practical, more so than anything. It's awesome. Also it speaks to what people that are living on the streets need in a wider sense is access to facilities . There's two types of facilities that would benefit from having community access to the first is necessary.\n\nUtilities like kitchen, shower, laundry. 'cause there aren't spaces where you can just go to do those necessary living function things for free. And the second, third space that would be amazing to see more so in the community is free spaces just to be and to build community from, for example a clothing exchange, like free clothing exchange, a place with couches, with a kitchen, with a lounge, just to hang out during the daytime.\n\nA place where there's a free bookshelf, a place that [00:02:00] encourages free trade. 'cause if you can facilitate an environment where people can help people, that's the best way to solve things. Most people are generous especially people that are in difficult situations. You'll see a lot of compassion because it's valued and we know how far, like a little help goes when things are rough. So if we could have spaces that are built around that mentality of give a little, get a little, a free space with facilities, that's what would really help in this situation. Built specifically, not so much around the idea of charity.\n\nAround community, around free trade, around art, around sharing knowledge and just helping each other.\n\nSo a great example of this that we need to see more of is street to stage. So I dunno if you know what that is. No. So street to stage is, it's run the past two years. The first was at Simple Sider and the second was.\n\nYouth arc. And so it was an opportunity for [00:03:00] people that had experienced houselessness or were currently experiencing houselessness to get up and play music or do poetry on stage. And that was so awesome 'cause it was bringing together people and sharing stories around a shared passion for music, which was so cool.\n\nAnd the energy was great. Oh, by the way, this is another point. The term homelessness. Is inaccurate. It should be houselessness because anybody who's in the situation understands the difference between a house and a home. House, four walls home, that feeling of love, and you can have that sense of home with you if you have community wherever you are, and if you have connection to the earth and to yourself, that's home.\n\nA house, just a place, so nobody can actually judge another being to say that they are homeless because that is something that we determine for ourselves. So I would say that I'm houseless. I don't have a house, but I am home wherever I go. I think that's important that we should change the language around that to better reflect the [00:04:00] situation as opposed to.\n\nAnd reduce the stigma a little bit. We're all people of this planet, who is anyone to say that anyone is homeless? Are we not still just beings altogether? There's no difference. It's no difference.\n\nRight now, in order to get access to those things for free people in this situation need to access them. At specific places at specific times, which can be a little bit inconvenient if you've got like a busy schedule or if you have work or all of those different things.\n\nSo it'd be great to have more free access hubs and also third spaces. To relax because in a heavily capitalistic society, there's emphasis on doing in all places. There's always a function, there's always an economic exchange. Whereas if we had places where it was accepted just to be and to exist. We could facilitate connections and friendships growing more organically and strengthen the community that way, as opposed to it being like, okay, you're in this spot to buy a [00:05:00] coffee.\n\nNobody talks to each other. This look at the phone. No. If it was just a place where we could all just be, that's, I think that would actually help the spirit of the city free spaces.\n\nStarting with the man in the mirror, like we lead by example and if each of us becomes the best we can be.\n\nThat's the true way to see the world get better, individuals making a difference in their own lives and that rippling out to see awesome change in the community.\n\nI don't know the gentleman personally, but from my experience with Orange Sky, it was a brilliant idea and keeping community at the core.\n\nOf any service is the way to keep a good vibe. Let them know. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nI really want a motorbike. That's my big, that's cool. Yeah, because once I have a motorbike, I can camp and I'll be the cool kind of houseless, not the street kind of houseless like Yeah. I don't know. [00:06:00] It's difficult also, if you've been living day to day for a while, just dealing with existence and the fundamentals.\n\nIf there isn't really a foundation, it's really difficult to actually plan ahead. When anybody asks me about the future, I'm like that doesn't exist. No, tomorrow. That does not exist.\n\nThere's several ways that I think that I can help and like conversations like these, if I have an idea. I wanna share that with the world, like more third spaces or letting you guys know about the issue with the hostels and stuff.\n\nSo here we go. Here's some knowledge I've learned, pass it on. But also self-improvement and being mindful in the way that I show up in day-to-day interactions with people and trying to just be kind. Which sounds simple, but I feel is huge. And also I'm thinking like music and art, definitely ideas are powerful.\n\nSpreading ideas is powerful, but the groundwork and just helping people out is also powerful and important. [00:07:00] It's all equally important, but what I'd like to do is make music so good that it just changes the world and makes everybody realize that the concept of housing is absurd and everything should be free and we can all live in peace.\n\nAnd I'll write a song that powerful and beautiful that everyone finally realizes that and then everything will be peaceful. There you go. That's my world domination plan. That's pretty, yeah, that's, yeah. That's pretty good. Yeah, I can, yeah, I'd love to hear that song. Yeah, me too. I'm still working on it.\n\nWhat, you got a particular. Genre of music you like more than others to play or to do? It depends on my mood. Like I do piano, guitar, singing, and electronic.

But so after a week or two, I literally stood in front of my mom as a two and a half year old. And I'm not gonna remember this because I've got identical memory, dude.\n\nSo I stood in front of her and I said, leave my mom alone. And so what happened was he's got there and he's punched me in the face and I went up against the wall mate and that was the day I was like, shit, life's real. You know what I mean? And like during that period, I also had to deal with a cousin that sexually assaulted me, right?\n\nAnd both those things played a huge role in me re oppressing who I knew I was like, before those things started, like from about two three, I knew. That I felt [00:03:00] different to the way that I, was perceived by everyone else in society. I thought things like, why can't I wear dresses? Why can't I play with the dolls?\n\nAll that sort of stuff. I'm like, why can't I do these things? And then I realized very quickly if I did do these things that, where I was brought up I would get harassed, bullied, et cetera. And even at that age, I knew not to be honest about that and essentially be like a version of myself.\n\nSo I was authentic, but not in the way that I expressed myself. I was reserved at times, even though I've got both autism and A DHD and I'm very outgoing. There were just a few things where I would just never speak about it. It never popped outta my head. And it was because I had a lot of shame around because it, at the time, this is the the nineties and the like, the two thousands to 2010.\n\nDuring that time, trans people weren't accepted. Even in those years, [00:04:00] gay bashing still happened. Like it was crazy, and it's changed so much in the last 10 to 15 years, like when it comes to acceptance, with the exception of this crazy stuff that's gone on over in the US at the moment, which is having a spillover effect.\n\nTo and proof in the footing there is as and we'll discuss in a minute, I'm currently homeless. I put a post up on Facebook to look for a house, right? And when I went to look for a house I mentioned in the post that myself and, or I should say my partner and I are both trans. So I am transfeminine.\n\nI was born with mostly male charact. Jurisdictions. Although I'm intersex, I've got chromosomes of xb, meaning I don't produce enough testosterone. Something I found out just before I started transitioning. So basically my partner or my fiance, he's was born female and he is transitioning to [00:05:00] male.\n\nAnd so like we just get each other and we've both got autism and a DH. Both dealt with try and we just gel. We just, we just get each other. So anyway, I put this post up because where, wherever we're living, like whether it's a landlord or whether we're in a share house, whoever we're living with or living in their house, they must be able to accept like the situation.\n\nBecause if that isn't the case, it becomes unsafe for us. And I don't worry so much about me because I'm. Very tough. Okay, let's go with that. And I can protect myself, but he is very naive. And if he was to grow up like where I did, I don't know if he would've survived, to be honest. And I just wanna protect him.\n\nEven though typically it's, the masculine role to be the protector, I still see myself that way, and. They, all these people on this post, they just responded. Didn't give a shit about, helping [00:06:00] people that were like escaping DV from ex-partners. They didn't care about that.\n\nAnd all they cared about was the fact that we were trans and. They just gave us the hardest of times and said all these horrible things just because we're trans dude and we're not harming anyone. Like we're two trans people that are together. Like we're not a trans person. That's with someone who's born cisgendered, meaning, they were born, the gender they identify with, and it actually relates back to a Greek term that means the same side as meaning. Okay, so you identify the way that you were born. You know what I mean? Yeah. So like a lot of people get pissed about the term cisgender, but it's no, we're not trying to call you a sissy dude.\n\nIt's. It's actually got a basis in language and there's a history there and what's that you brought it up a second ago. That experience of homelessness for you? Because it's different. Yeah. That's the new thing for me, and the biggest concern that I had to start off with when I realized that I had to [00:07:00] essentially either live in a shelter or jump into a tent, is that if I went into a shelter, then I'm gonna be interacting with personalities.\n\nAnd I know it's gonna be very much my upbringing, right? I'm going into situation where everyone's got their own issues, they've got their mental health and all that sort of stuff. And I'm like, okay, am I gonna get into a situation where they're gonna want to hurt me? Am I gonna have to keep an eye over my shoulder?\n\nAnd. Thankfully I haven't had that. Everyone's been awesome, every, as I said, everyone does have their stuff. They've got their mental health and whatnot, but who wouldn't? We're homeless, dude. That's, that's the honest truth. But no, everyone's generally respectful and everyone has their bad days, but for the most part, we try to help each other out and.\n\nGet through this and whenever someone gets a house, we're happy for 'em. You know what I mean? It's awesome. But I originally started in the safe space in burn. So what happened was I was living in Latrobe for [00:08:00] 13 years. That was with my ex-partner. And I couldn't stay there because even though I had a family violence order against her after she stabbed me with a pair of kitchen scissors because she got violent, I even though like she wasn't allowed to come near me 'cause I got the violence order, what she did is she'd send her stepfather around and he, that, that's where she got the mentality from her stepfather. He would literally go around and rob drug dealers of their drugs. Like he would go and steal pot from the, like he was a nasty man and I had to tolerate him for 18 years of giving me shit, calling me a pussy, doing all this sort of stuff.\n\n'cause even before I come outta Strands. Like I wasn't good enough for his little girl, I wasn't strong enough. I wasn't, because even though no one knew until I told someone that I was gender vessel trans, I still had a more timid nature because I wouldn't do typically alpha male things.\n\nLike I wouldn't give the boys shit. I'd be like, oh, come on, let it go. [00:09:00] You know what I mean? Like I'd play it off like it's not a big deal, but, I wouldn't be a jerk about it and try and join in. There was like a lot of roughhousing in the neighborhoods as kids and like I wouldn't join in on that and I'd probably say, leave him alone.\n\nBut I do feel a bit guilty for not stepping in and saying something a bit more sometimes. And that's. It also directly relates to, the coming out and being comfortable with it, especially in a place like this. I'm like, okay, here we go. Let's go in. But the fact that I'm autistic is such a key asset when it comes to that.\n\nBecause a big thing with being autistic is narrative, right? So if you're in a situation that you've not dealt with before, what tends to happen is you tend to go through it in your head before you have to deal with it as best you can. And then when you get there just like a story on a screen, it plays out a bit like a script.\n\nYeah. And so like I'm going through all the [00:10:00] 10,000 scenarios in my head because I'm an A DHD as well. You add those two together and you got someone who's very specific, logical, and thinks a midling miles a second, right? And so everything's just gone. All the scenarios are gone through my head and I'm like calculating it all.\n\nAnd I'm like, okay, cool. All right. I know what we're gonna do when we're going here. We're gonna. We're going in as the doctor which doing a medical degree by the way. Yeah. Hoping to become a trans doctor. Cool. Someone who helps other people in my situation. 'cause there's not enough in Tasie. Yeah.\n\nThere just isn't. And sorry bud. You go. You sweet. Yeah. What do you think about this iron inspire thing? Is this Oh me. I couldn't believe it. I get here and I'm like, people do my washing for me. I was the total like, housewife type person even before I transitioned 'cause stayed at home as a carer for my son sort of thing.\n\nAnd so like I was always doing the house. I got here and I'm like, oh my God, someone's gonna do my washing for me. And it's such an invaluable service. 'cause you don't think of the little things that [00:11:00] you're gonna struggle with if you're homeless, at washing. And so at the moment, you, I'm okay. I need to make sure that I've got the outfits, the week sort of thing. I need to make sure I get here on, this day sort of thing or go there that day. You have to think of those things and that's why it's hard for say a homeless person to hold down a job and that sort of thing because they have to go to all these different places just to get, the essential, things they need that basic human rights I would call. Yeah.\n\nAnd what, how did you first hear it? Did you just stumble across this and what did you sorry, I actually found out about it here. But they said, oh yeah, there's someone that comes around to your washing. And they explained it to me, but then. I didn't realize, I thought they come around, picked it up, went away.\n\nI didn't realize there was, the van and the the dryers and everything. And I like when they hooked a lot, I'm like, oh, this is awesome. This makes so much more sense. Coming up with a creative solution like that for something just so [00:12:00] essential and having it, portable so they can go to different spots because, again, homeless probably not gonna have transport.\n\nSo being able to move and do this is the way to go. Yeah, for sure. And what about this idea of part of it's watching and part of it's conversation, having a yarn with volunteers and Oh yeah. I'm all on board with that. Like everyone's great. And even just being able to go and say, Hey, look.\n\nI'll give you an example. I had, I've got this awesome pair of rainbow shoes, dude. They're massive. Everyone's oh yeah. I'm like, yeah, if anyone gives me a hard time, I'm gonna put the rainbow up their house. But anyway I'd wore 'em without socks, which I tend to do 'cause I always lose my socks, right?\n\nNo reason. And so anyway I come out and ask 'em if they can wash 'em for me, and I had to wash 'em a few times to get like the, the dirty or smelly feet smell. Out of them. And I'm like, it's awesome. They just wanted the effort to do that. They're not getting paid by me. Obviously it's funding from somewhere.\n\nBut it was just awesome that, and I love it because I used to run a computer [00:13:00] business that was low cost for pensioners and putting in the effort even though the big bucks aren't there. That's awesome. That's just so awesome. What do you, what's your sort of concept of. Impact of this service.\n\nThese, they're all around the country. They do washing. It's a little bit of, yeah. Just quick question. Do they do any other services? I wasn't, I'm not sure. I know they do the washings showers. Showers and then which they start again. Is there one here for showers or I don't think so.\n\nOnly reason I was asking is because, i'm normally onto it down at the safe space night facility, but I missed it this morning. I got there and I'm looking at 10 past seven. I was meant to be in at seven and I'm like, oh no. Sharon Mother's Day. That's brutal. It's already a terrible day for all of us.\n\nSo no if showers washers and then they flex after going into remote communities and having, okay. Yeah, no, that's awesome. I've got indigenous heritage, so it's cool to hear that. 'cause like especially out on some of the the like in the nt [00:14:00] Yeah. Some of the more rural places, they're essentially Yeah.\n\nThey need that sort of stuff. 'cause they might not have Yeah. Good running water. They might have running water, but it might not, and do you think the impact is more around the washing or. People talk about that idea of connection and conversation. Yeah. Yeah. It's awesome having someone have a chat.\n\nJust before we started there, I was over there having a chat with one of the ladies and just, as I do start talking and don't stop told her in my story and then obviously you've come over and to have a chat and that yeah. Yeah. No, it's awesome to be able to do that because.\n\nEspecially at the moment, bud, like I had to leave the northwest for my safety. So I don't, I, I know a few people down here. I've got a few friends. But yeah, you need to be able to have those charts, especially when you're going through a time that's probably not the greatest in your life. Yeah. 'cause no one, obviously wants to be homeless.\n\nI don't believe. You've got the odd ones who struggle to, to get out of it. And I'm really hoping that I don't have an issue obtaining housing. I [00:15:00] know that I'm gonna be motivated to do i'm only I've probably been living rough for about a month. Essentially what happened was I had to leave Latrobe for my safety.\n\nI couldn't stay with my current partner because he lives in like an independent living. Thing where they've got like onsite support and they've got a thing in the lease where you can't have a second person reside. And they were issuing like him with an eviction notice and all this, and I'm like, I can't make someone else homeless.\n\nSo I'm like, no, rather than do that, let me go do something more productive. Let me go to the safe space in Hobart and find us a house, where it's safe and away from the problem. So yeah, that's how I ended up here. That's cool. I could talk all day. I know buddy. I know. And hey mate, I can talk to you under there.\n\nTalk. I've gotta talk with one of them. Yeah, sure. People as well. Yeah. I'll just take a quick photo. Yeah, of course bud. Just stay right there for me.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2d:T60d,# The Essential Need for Acceptance\n\n~~And so like we just get each other and we've both got autism and a DH.

It's Bridget Perry, B-R-I-G-I-T-P-E-R-R-Y. go@outlook.com.\n\nAlright.\n\nI grew up in Northern California in Sonoma County wine country, and I lived there for most of my life. I met my now husband online in 2002 before it was cool. He likes to say, oh, cool. 2001 actually. And we got married in 2011 and I moved.\n\nHere to [00:01:00] Canberra. My husband grew up here in Canberra. I lived here his whole life. So I moved here and I've been here ever since. It's just a little bit about me. When did you first hear about Orange Sky? When Nick and Lucas won Young Australian of the Year. Wow. Yeah, I love watching Young Australian, or I love watching Australia the year.\n\nI love hearing everybody's stories. I always have had a big piece of my heart in charity work, and I love that people are creative in the ways that they can give to a community and the innovation that people do for things. And I thought, oh my gosh, a mobile laundry service. How? Totally brilliant. What a great, amazing idea.\n\nSo I was really impressed. And when they came to Canberra and they were looking for volunteers, I signed up immediately. I said, I want in on that.\n\nI think mostly it's just [00:02:00] because of the way that I was raised. I was raised by very giving generous parents, and I grew up in a church that was very loving and it was always about taking care of people in your community and people around you. And I also for a while, worked with kids in out-of-home care and one of my housemates she worked for.\n\nA women's shelter and it's just like a, an awareness that there are people in your community that need help.\n\nOrange sky has done such a good job of taking that stigma out of it and saying, this is a person and this person has a name, and this person has a story. And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking [00:03:00] to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things. And it's really nice to be able to share with them why I do it and why it's important to take care of people, even if they're people that you don't know.\n\nIt's no secret. I tell everyone that I volunteer and, i've made it known to a lot of people. I've done the Sudsy challenge a few times. I like having those conversations and telling people this, there's more to life than just doing what you do. It's about giving back to your community.\n\nIn the beginning it was really cool to be like, oh, a mobile laundry service.\n\nBut then to have seen things [00:04:00] evolve over time and then to say it's not just about laundry. It's about letting people. Be heard, and people who are homeless often go all day without talking to anyone. So to have a place for people to come and talk to people, that's huge. That's a huge connection point that people are missing.\n\nAnd to make that realization in the process of, oh, we're doing something great by washing people's clothes. Oh, but also there's an added benefit to it that might even be more important.\n\nA lot of conversation is waiting for your turn to talk. You say something, I think of something to say in response, but sometimes people just want to be listened to and you don't have to say anything in response.\n\nYou could just listen. And that makes it very validating for that person to just have somebody listening and go, oh, really? Oh, that's what's [00:05:00] going on for you? Oh, that must be hard, or That must be nice. Or whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. The more I do this stuff, the more I realize, like stories are very broad.\n\nIn my in my Orange Sky world, I have been trying to push that. Volunteers in Canberra need alcohol and other drug harm reduction training. I think that's really important for volunteers here. Because of the decriminalization of personalized or drugs for personalized use. And I think that there are a lot of times that people on shift, especially at night encounter people who are using drugs or are on drugs at the time that they come to shift.\n\nAnd if there was an overdose, would volunteers know how to do something about that or. [00:06:00] If they notice somebody's on drugs, is there a way to feel more comfortable and not be just immediately scared and think, oh no, that's a scary drug addict. Like they're people too. They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and [00:07:00] thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\nWhen I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money? And she's you can give all the money in the world, but if there's nobody willing to. Do the time on the shift, then what's the point?\n\nYou have to have somebody doing the work. And that's what I like to tell my kids. Like it's not just about what you can give money to, 'cause that's important also, but it's about being there, being the hands, making it work. Otherwise it falls apart. Yeah. Yeah. Make us are very good at [00:08:00] trying to. Dumb down the impact of one part of the organization and being like, everyone lifts it, right?\n\nWhether it's a little kid giving five bucks to volunteer volunteers or yeah. Trying to work out how they can have that full understanding of what it takes to run this things.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"2f:T15a0,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"\u003c�!DOCTYPE html\u003e \u003c�html lang=\"en\"\u003e \u003c�head\u003e \u003c�meta charset=\"UTF-8\" /\u003e \u003c�title\u003eAaron Stapleton\u003c�/title\u003e \u003c�/head\u003e \u003c�body\u003e \u003c�h1\u003eAaron Stapleton\u003c�/h1\u003e \u003c�p\u003e\u003c�span style=\"color:#808080\"\u003e[00:00:00]\u003c�/span\u003e \u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eBra.

And what about, a bit about yourself though?\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eThat's, tell us a bit about our story. My story this time last year, I was basically running a company as a managing supervisor. A few bad things happened. A few people passed away, things went bad. Break up with a partner. Ended up getting myself locked up, come outta jail with nowhere to go. Basically lived on the streets around here for about two months or so until I was fortunate enough to get a place here.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eAnd just getting back on my feet now, mate. \u003c�span style=\"color:#808080\"\u003e[00:01:00]\u003c�/span\u003e Yeah. Stubborn for myself again, and get back into all this. Yeah. How does that sort of, like people, I think general people struggle with this idea of homelessness, struggle, marginalization and stuff. Yeah. How would you explain your own experience?\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eI guess they aren't too sure about what's going on. For me it was first moral denial. I didn't wanna think I was a basically homeless, say bum on the street and stuff like that, yeah. It's hard experience, especially asking for help and stuff, especially like someone like me doesn't usually ask for help and stuff like that.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eBut when you're in the position that we have been, when you're going through this, you realize you need help. Any little thing can really help, I found I've met a lot of people in the same position too, which there's been some really nice people. There's also been some really bad people, some bad influences and stuff like that, and just.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eDrinking and drugs that go on stuff around here, just keep clear of that. And I do my own thing. I love fishing in my spare time, stuff like that. So \u003c�span style=\"color:#808080\"\u003e[00:02:00]\u003c�/span\u003e yeah, I'd rather go out fishing than hang around some of the bad people, but yeah, homelessness, you never think it's gonna happen to you 'cause it could any day.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eLike I said, I was a manager of company only $60,000 a year last year. And I lost it all like that. Yeah. Say how would you say eyeopening experience makes you a bit more humble? Appreciate and a lot more things, and also want those things too back, so now it's basically up to me. I've yeah, done a fair bit of work at, people who have been incarcerated and especially young people and stuff.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eYeah. How would you explain that experience from going into coming out? How would I explain it? It's not my first time I've been in jail. I'm like one of the older groups in jail now. It's horrible place, but everyone ends up there for a reason, it's a horrible place.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eThat's what I wanna say, mate. But usually, yeah, people that are in there for a reason and yeah. Avoid it at all costs. Yeah. The petty bullshit that people do to get themselves in there isn't really worth at the end of the day. You \u003c�span style=\"color:#808080\"\u003e[00:03:00]\u003c�/span\u003e can earn a lot more in one day's work that you can from stealing or robbing or whatever, whatever you've done wrong to get in there.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eAnd what about that transition out period? Transition out period? So this is what I found hard. While I knew I was getting out, I had a sentence date. I knew what was coming up and that, and I had about two months to go left on the sentence, and I was trying to ring around and find a place to go because I'd been staying with my mother before this.\u003c�/p\u003e \u003c�p\u003eBut she's a bad drug user. I was doing really well and she sold everything I had. I had nothing to go back to. So I was trying to find places, for example, caravan, parks everywhere.

Like that idea of having someone to talk to that is not paid and a volunteer and is doing this with their own time?~~[00:00:00] \n\nYou can always tell when someone's a volunteer because they're there, not because they're being paid, they're there 'cause they wanna be there, right? So they're not just, oh, hate me, job buddy, wash me clothes. They're up for a chat, they're down to earth. They've seen people in our positions, they know what it's like.\n\nYeah, it's good just to have someone to talk to, mate, because, like even though I live in a house full of blokes, it's different here. Like just different conversations sometimes, yeah, just a friendly space, a smile, and I got the the the tart as well was a bonus today, the little cream cake.\n\nThat was nice as well. Yeah. Nah. Excellent mate~~ . yeah. Is is there anything else we didn't talk about that you'd be keen to say or anything else that you've always wanted to say about just anyone that can support this fo this this venture or however it's supported, funded wherever I'd encourage people to help out wherever they can towards the service.~~\n\n31:T19d5,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Briget_Perry\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nBriget Perry: B-R-I-G-I-T. Yep. P-E-R-R-Y-R-Y. Cool. And would you like me to send this to you in email or telephone number or text? I think email would be good. Okay. What's your email? It's Bridget Perry, B-R-I-G-I-T-P-E-R-R-Y. go@outlook.com.\n\nAlright.\n\nI grew up in Northern California in Sonoma County wine country, and I lived there for most of my life. I met my now husband online in 2002 before it was cool. He likes to say, oh, cool. 2001 actually. And we got married in 2011 and I moved.\n\nHere to [00:01:00] Canberra. My husband grew up here in Canberra. I lived here his whole life. So I moved here and I've been here ever since. It's just a little bit about me. When did you first hear about Orange Sky? When Nick and Lucas won Young Australian of the Year. Wow. Yeah, I love watching Young Australian, or I love watching Australia the year.\n\nI love hearing everybody's stories. I always have had a big piece of my heart in charity work, and I love that people are creative in the ways that they can give to a community and the innovation that people do for things. And I thought, oh my gosh, a mobile laundry service. How? Totally brilliant. What a great, amazing idea.\n\nSo I was really impressed. And when they came to Canberra and they were looking for volunteers, I signed up immediately. I said, I want in on that.\n\nI think mostly it's just [00:02:00] because of the way that I was raised. I was raised by very giving generous parents, and I grew up in a church that was very loving and it was always about taking care of people in your community and people around you. And I also for a while, worked with kids in out-of-home care and one of my housemates she worked for.\n\nA women's shelter and it's just like a, an awareness that there are people in your community that need help.\n\nOrange sky has done such a good job of taking that stigma out of it and saying, this is a person and this person has a name, and this person has a story. And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking [00:03:00] to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things. And it's really nice to be able to share with them why I do it and why it's important to take care of people, even if they're people that you don't know.\n\nIt's no secret. I tell everyone that I volunteer and, i've made it known to a lot of people. I've done the Sudsy challenge a few times. I like having those conversations and telling people this, there's more to life than just doing what you do. It's about giving back to your community.\n\nIn the beginning it was really cool to be like, oh, a mobile laundry service.\n\nBut then to have seen things [00:04:00] evolve over time and then to say it's not just about laundry. It's about letting people. Be heard, and people who are homeless often go all day without talking to anyone. So to have a place for people to come and talk to people, that's huge. That's a huge connection point that people are missing.\n\nAnd to make that realization in the process of, oh, we're doing something great by washing people's clothes. Oh, but also there's an added benefit to it that might even be more important.\n\nA lot of conversation is waiting for your turn to talk. You say something, I think of something to say in response, but sometimes people just want to be listened to and you don't have to say anything in response.\n\nYou could just listen. And that makes it very validating for that person to just have somebody listening and go, oh, really? Oh, that's what's [00:05:00] going on for you? Oh, that must be hard, or That must be nice. Or whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. The more I do this stuff, the more I realize, like stories are very broad.\n\nIn my in my Orange Sky world, I have been trying to push that. Volunteers in Canberra need alcohol and other drug harm reduction training. I think that's really important for volunteers here. Because of the decriminalization of personalized or drugs for personalized use. And I think that there are a lot of times that people on shift, especially at night encounter people who are using drugs or are on drugs at the time that they come to shift.\n\nAnd if there was an overdose, would volunteers know how to do something about that or. [00:06:00] If they notice somebody's on drugs, is there a way to feel more comfortable and not be just immediately scared and think, oh no, that's a scary drug addict. Like they're people too. They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and [00:07:00] thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\nWhen I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money? And she's you can give all the money in the world, but if there's nobody willing to. Do the time on the shift, then what's the point?\n\nYou have to have somebody doing the work. And that's what I like to tell my kids. Like it's not just about what you can give money to, 'cause that's important also, but it's about being there, being the hands, making it work. Otherwise it falls apart. Yeah. Yeah. Make us are very good at [00:08:00] trying to. Dumb down the impact of one part of the organization and being like, everyone lifts it, right?\n\nWhether it's a little kid giving five bucks to volunteer volunteers or yeah. Trying to work out how they can have that full understanding of what it takes to run this things.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"32:T4ec,Humanising Help: Every Person Has a Story\n===\n\nBriget Perry: ~And I also for a while, worked with kids in out-of-home care and one of my housemates she worked for.~\n\n~A women's shelter and it's just like a, an awareness that there are people in your community that need help.~[00:00:00] \n\nOrange sky has done such a good job of taking that stigma out of it and saying, this is a person and this person has a name, and this person has a story.

And I'm a driver volunteer. So good. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. How long have I I was trying to work out if it's two or three years I've been volunteering here, but I retired in 2021 and was looking for some role in volunteering.\n\nAnd this was an area I hadn't really worked with before. So I was, and saw a bit of advertising for it and [00:01:00] just thought why not? So I put my name down and been here since. And we only, we have two volunteer, schedule. So we only do it fortnightly, which is good. And if you're gonna go away, it means that you don't have to be bound to turn up every time.\n\nSo it's very flexible and it's good. Awesome. Yeah. And how did you hear about it on this Skype? I retired last year and took up some volunteering, but I knew the boys when they first started 10 years ago in Brisbane. And we used to, have some of our volunteers where I worked there come and join the.\n\nThe work of Orange Sky back then. So connected to it for a long time. And how did you connect that back up with it in Adelaide? Did you pursue it or see it? Oh, just I knew they'd started working 'cause the bus is parked or the, our little van Splasher is parked down the road from where I live and thought it's handy for me.\n\nI can do this and. I come out on a Tuesday night, but here I am on a Friday morning, which is lovely. Just filling in today. And what keeps you coming [00:02:00] back to Orange Sky? Like why do you Yeah, I think it's the friends that come to have the chat and the people that you are on the shift with and it just feels good to volunteer and yeah, I used to work in a school environment before, so that community feel, I enjoy that and I find this is very similar yeah.\n\nAnd what's, has your sort of take on what orange sky does or homelessness or yeah, even like how you talk about with your friends, has that changed over your time volunteering or stayed the same? Yeah, most probably. 'cause as I said, it was an area I wasn't really had much involvement in. And I was really impressed with how the guys have operated it.\n\nI mean they're it's obviously got bigger, but. I think what they're out aimed to do is, hasn't changed. And I think it's helpful. And it's not necessarily just the homeless, it's the people that just don't have those vans that a washing machine might break or can't afford to run it, instead of hitting all people.\n\nAnd I love that it's here and they can go in and [00:03:00] have a meal. So you know, they're getting covered always. What does it I guess what does it feel like for someone who hasn't been on shift? What's a general shift like for yourself or this? So coming as a driver, I head in and pick the van up, bring it down here to Glenelg and try not to crash the van.\n\n'cause that'd be a bit of a disaster if it did. And then we set up and, just starting out, you get to learn how the van works and you've got other volunteers here who've done it before. So you learn and then you just interact with the people who bring their washing in for all sorts of reasons.\n\nYou hear some of their stories, which is really lovely to hear some, it's very sad at times. And I suppose there's that thing, you're, for many people, they're just two disasters away from needing this service or needing a roof over their head. And, yeah. So that's the sad part of it, but providing some service, providing some help, it's always appreciated.\n\nYeah. So cool. What's something that surprised [00:04:00] you maybe about R Sky or working here, or friends, so something that surprised you, like after little world of being? I thought in the beginning, and I can't remember it happening, but I remember just getting like a birthday. It can, like happy birthday from the whole orange Sky which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\nSo Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities. It's not an easy task, but I think they do it well. Yeah. Yeah. We operate with our service provider here. What's the relationship like and why do you think it's beneficial to, to work with a I think it's, it gives you a [00:05:00] connection, a reason for being here.\n\nAnd the good part here today, they're getting lunch on Tuesday nights. They get a lovely dinner. And so there's a purpose there. And then the relationship with the people who are coming to work in their volunteer service and we get to know them and they get to know us, and they appreciate what we bring to their community down here.\n\nI'm always fascinated, like Orange Spots had this tagline forever. Positively connecting communities. Yeah. Always been. Yeah, I guess people draw whatever they want from that, but there's a whole range of impact that's available here, which is is washing somewhere, there's showers, sometimes there's conversation.\n\nYou know what I mean? Yeah. Is there something that you think stands out more than others in terms of what impact it might have on an individual? I think it's just nice for some of these people. They might not get to interact very much, especially if they're on the streets and depending on the different where the van goes here, I think it's good 'cause the church has quite a good [00:06:00] idea on them.\n\nBut we were only saying at the start of this year, there's one person that we normally used to see, didn't usually always use. The van would come and chat with us. We haven't seen him come back. And then you keep asking the questions and hopefully someone checks in. And we've heard that possibly he's had a fall.\n\nAnd I think that's a good thing with it is you get those connections and you look out for 'em and yeah, it's just nice to get to know them. Yeah. Yeah. We had a similar one to be heard. Yeah. There was a similar one with a, a young mum and family. And, she hadn't been around for a while, and then she was here a couple of weeks ago and she said, oh no, I'm all good now I've moved to Burra and I've got a house and we've got three little pitties that can run wild.\n\nSo that was, just a positive story to hear from that lady who we'd done a washing for. She'd always arrived late and have a whole swag of washing and Oh wow. Wed get it done. And but yeah, it was lovely to hear that she'd settled and feeling really good. That's cool. Yeah. And [00:07:00] I'm just always interested in what is the influence on you as a person outside of Orange Sky?\n\nDo you think, are there conversations you have that come back about orange sky and your surprise that people's take on it? Or what are those conversations that you have in your social circle? And or even in public, can they be difficult sometimes? I suppose I've got friends that are in that field anyway, but then there's other people you might say you volunteer, just in a general conversation with someone you haven't met before.\n\nThere's a lot of people that still aren't aware of Iron Sky, and then when they hear what it does, they just say, oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I suppose just trying to get it out there as much as you can, but yeah. No, I think most people think it's a great idea. Yeah. And are there particular challenges of being a volunteer?\n\nI think we've heard a few this morning. The van, yeah, when the van doesn't work, you get, people can't get my drawing done today. Oh it's a where will used asset and it's starting to show [00:08:00] sometimes we're not too bad here, but occasionally I've helped out in a couple of shifts and you get some interesting and.\n\nSort of behaviors, and I know one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But yeah, it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nSo Yeah. And it's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\nWhat's the, what's your feeling about Adelaide in [00:09:00] general in terms of whether it's class or marginalization or struggle what's your general take on Adelaide's? Like temperature or like sentiment? At all that stuff. Is it, do you think it's like high or low at the moment or, I'm not sure.\n\nTension or, I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets. And I think we've noticed it here just in the last 18 months, more people coming to get their washing done and you ask them where they're staying and they'll tell you, oh, in this driveway in the winter we are going to a car park.\n\nThose sorts of things. Yeah. But then also just generally, some may not be homeless, but the cost of living pinch is increasing, that's for sure. But yeah. Are there more things you think orange sky should be doing, can be doing? It's always interesting, like I think I heard a stat the other day that orange sky has the second most touch points of people experiencing [00:10:00] homelessness in Australia.\n\nNow, are there things that you think they should do more of? Or do you think they should like fit in their lane what they don't? I think the showers down here might be a thing. Yeah, I think the showers might be handy, but I think they're. I think it's good to keep doing what you do well.\n\nBut yeah, definitely I think the showers and that might help, but like anything new, it takes a while, so it's not just gonna be picked up straight away, so you need to be a little bit. Yeah. Here's some questions more for me, but I, yeah, I'm trying to work out how if you can.\n\nAnd how do you tell stories or do highlights shift that then get shared back? I'm just wondering if you had a way to see what other shifts are doing or what other shifts are like, see videos and photos of other shifts and even like almost search to see sentiment, that sort of stuff.\n\nIs that something you'd be interested in and why? I think particularly other states I think would be interesting to see how it works. Yeah. [00:11:00] Would there be certain ways that you'd love to see that or interact with that? Like it's no. No. Good. Just making another Apple place. I suppose they've got that website and I can't see why you couldn't add it to that.\n\nIt's not always the most user friendly website, but. I'm sure that can improve. Yeah. Just to, have a story, say from, I'd love to see how they work in the remote communities. Yeah. Having spent a bit of time working in those over the years and even in the floods, yeah. Things like that.\n\nSo just have, even if there's just a little, like you say a video of here's what we did in, at T Anger or wherever in, in the Kimberley. And then tell that story. And just have it there so you can say, we've got a new story up and that'll come out on the little message.\n\nHere's the link. So you go in and have a look at it. Yeah. Here's the story from, St. Mary's in Adelaide. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to work out. What's something that you can offer that's not like to some other random place to go over to something That's interesting. And because they do the weekly or the monthly magazine that you get emailed, but.\n\nYou [00:12:00] don't always have time to click into those things. All right. Yeah. 'cause I'd love to even if it's okay to test something with you after this sometime during the week I'll work our away to get like a link to this shift. And you guys, I'm not the best person to do 'cause I'm overseas as of Saturday night.\n\nThat's even better because I wonder, like you when you come back. Yeah, if it's still available and it's, yeah. Like I'd love to work out. I might have access to emails in that anyway when I'm away yeah. Cool. Yeah. 'cause the whole idea of this project is almost like, how do you tell a story but then make sure that there's a participation?\n\nYeah. That's true. Then you, this idea of I think Orange Sky's quite good at promoting themselves on social media and stuff, but I wonder what else we can do to almost like, like we're connecting communities. I wonder how, what else you can do to connect this community up more and because I think they connect to volunteers.\n\nIt's the, the friends that who don't have all the access to media that, how do you, they're good at putting them with venues [00:13:00] that they're coming for, for a meal. So yes, they'll come into the washing, but that must be one of the hardest challenges, I think, for them to, 'cause you've got it.\n\nAnd some shifts would be quieter than others. But. Yeah. Just I'm fascinated at what happens when you give someone agency over engaging as much as they want. Yeah. I was almost fascinated with anyone that wants to sit down and tell their story. So yeah. I just hope that we can find a way where people that tell a story feel good about it and you've done something.\n\nYeah. And they can see it. Yeah. Awesome. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"34:T37cc,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"# Tracy \u0026 Jared\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nThese broadcast comes, oh, an acronym for a military.

It can, like happy birthday from the whole orange Sky which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\nSo Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities. It's not an easy task, but I think they do it well. Yeah. Yeah. We operate with our service provider here. What's the relationship like and why do you think it's beneficial to, to work with a I think it's, it gives you a [00:05:00] connection, a reason for being here.\n\nAnd the good part here today, they're getting lunch on Tuesday nights. They get a lovely dinner. And so there's a purpose there. And then the relationship with the people who are coming to work in their volunteer service and we get to know them and they get to know us, and they appreciate what we bring to their community down here.\n\nI'm always fascinated, like Orange Spots had this tagline forever. Positively connecting communities. Yeah. Always been. Yeah, I guess people draw whatever they want from that, but there's a whole range of impact that's available here, which is is washing somewhere, there's showers, sometimes there's conversation.\n\nYou know what I mean? Yeah. Is there something that you think stands out more than others in terms of what impact it might have on an individual? I think it's just nice for some of these people. They might not get to interact very much, especially if they're on the streets and depending on the different where the van goes here, I think it's good 'cause the church has quite a good [00:06:00] idea on them.\n\nBut we were only saying at the start of this year, there's one person that we normally used to see, didn't usually always use. The van would come and chat with us. We haven't seen him come back. And then you keep asking the questions and hopefully someone checks in. And we've heard that possibly he's had a fall.\n\nAnd I think that's a good thing with it is you get those connections and you look out for 'em and yeah, it's just nice to get to know them. Yeah. Yeah. We had a similar one to be heard. Yeah. There was a similar one with a, a young mum and family. And, she hadn't been around for a while, and then she was here a couple of weeks ago and she said, oh no, I'm all good now I've moved to Burra and I've got a house and we've got three little pitties that can run wild.\n\nSo that was, just a positive story to hear from that lady who we'd done a washing for. She'd always arrived late and have a whole swag of washing and Oh wow. Wed get it done. And but yeah, it was lovely to hear that she'd settled and feeling really good. That's cool. Yeah. And [00:07:00] I'm just always interested in what is the influence on you as a person outside of Orange Sky?\n\nDo you think, are there conversations you have that come back about orange sky and your surprise that people's take on it? Or what are those conversations that you have in your social circle? And or even in public, can they be difficult sometimes? I suppose I've got friends that are in that field anyway, but then there's other people you might say you volunteer, just in a general conversation with someone you haven't met before.\n\nThere's a lot of people that still aren't aware of Iron Sky, and then when they hear what it does, they just say, oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I suppose just trying to get it out there as much as you can, but yeah. No, I think most people think it's a great idea. Yeah. And are there particular challenges of being a volunteer?\n\nI think we've heard a few this morning. The van, yeah, when the van doesn't work, you get, people can't get my drawing done today. Oh it's a where will used asset and it's starting to show [00:08:00] sometimes we're not too bad here, but occasionally I've helped out in a couple of shifts and you get some interesting and.\n\nSort of behaviors, and I know one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But yeah, it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nSo Yeah. And it's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\nWhat's the, what's your feeling about Adelaide in [00:09:00] general in terms of whether it's class or marginalization or struggle what's your general take on Adelaide's? Like temperature or like sentiment? At all that stuff. Is it, do you think it's like high or low at the moment or, I'm not sure.\n\nTension or, I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets. And I think we've noticed it here just in the last 18 months, more people coming to get their washing done and you ask them where they're staying and they'll tell you, oh, in this driveway in the winter we are going to a car park.\n\nThose sorts of things. Yeah. But then also just generally, some may not be homeless, but the cost of living pinch is increasing, that's for sure. But yeah. Are there more things you think orange sky should be doing, can be doing? It's always interesting, like I think I heard a stat the other day that orange sky has the second most touch points of people experiencing [00:10:00] homelessness in Australia.\n\nNow, are there things that you think they should do more of? Or do you think they should like fit in their lane what they don't? I think the showers down here might be a thing. Yeah, I think the showers might be handy, but I think they're. I think it's good to keep doing what you do well.\n\nBut yeah, definitely I think the showers and that might help, but like anything new, it takes a while, so it's not just gonna be picked up straight away, so you need to be a little bit. Yeah. Here's some questions more for me, but I, yeah, I'm trying to work out how if you can.\n\nAnd how do you tell stories or do highlights shift that then get shared back? I'm just wondering if you had a way to see what other shifts are doing or what other shifts are like, see videos and photos of other shifts and even like almost search to see sentiment, that sort of stuff.\n\nIs that something you'd be interested in and why? I think particularly other states I think would be interesting to see how it works. Yeah. [00:11:00] Would there be certain ways that you'd love to see that or interact with that? Like it's no. No. Good. Just making another Apple place. I suppose they've got that website and I can't see why you couldn't add it to that.\n\nIt's not always the most user friendly website, but. I'm sure that can improve. Yeah. Just to, have a story, say from, I'd love to see how they work in the remote communities. Yeah. Having spent a bit of time working in those over the years and even in the floods, yeah. Things like that.\n\nSo just have, even if there's just a little, like you say a video of here's what we did in, at T Anger or wherever in, in the Kimberley. And then tell that story. And just have it there so you can say, we've got a new story up and that'll come out on the little message.\n\nHere's the link. So you go in and have a look at it. Yeah. Here's the story from, St. Mary's in Adelaide. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to work out. What's something that you can offer that's not like to some other random place to go over to something That's interesting. And because they do the weekly or the monthly magazine that you get emailed, but.\n\nYou [00:12:00] don't always have time to click into those things. All right. Yeah. 'cause I'd love to even if it's okay to test something with you after this sometime during the week I'll work our away to get like a link to this shift. And you guys, I'm not the best person to do 'cause I'm overseas as of Saturday night.\n\nThat's even better because I wonder, like you when you come back. Yeah, if it's still available and it's, yeah. Like I'd love to work out. I might have access to emails in that anyway when I'm away yeah. Cool. Yeah. 'cause the whole idea of this project is almost like, how do you tell a story but then make sure that there's a participation?\n\nYeah. That's true. Then you, this idea of I think Orange Sky's quite good at promoting themselves on social media and stuff, but I wonder what else we can do to almost like, like we're connecting communities. I wonder how, what else you can do to connect this community up more and because I think they connect to volunteers.\n\nIt's the, the friends that who don't have all the access to media that, how do you, they're good at putting them with venues [00:13:00] that they're coming for, for a meal. So yes, they'll come into the washing, but that must be one of the hardest challenges, I think, for them to, 'cause you've got it.\n\nAnd some shifts would be quieter than others. But. Yeah. Just I'm fascinated at what happens when you give someone agency over engaging as much as they want. Yeah. I was almost fascinated with anyone that wants to sit down and tell their story. So yeah. I just hope that we can find a way where people that tell a story feel good about it and you've done something.\n\nYeah. And they can see it. Yeah. Awesome. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"35:T465,# Just Two Disasters Away\n\n~~So you learn and then you just interact with the people who bring their washing in for all sorts of reasons.~~\n\n~~You hear some of their stories, which is really lovely to hear some, it's very sad at times.

And I'm a driver volunteer. So good. Tell me a little bit about yourself first. How long have I I was trying to work out if it's two or three years I've been volunteering here, but I retired in 2021 and was looking for some role in volunteering.\n\nAnd this was an area I hadn't really worked with before. So I was, and saw a bit of advertising for it and [00:01:00] just thought why not? So I put my name down and been here since. And we only, we have two volunteer, schedule. So we only do it fortnightly, which is good. And if you're gonna go away, it means that you don't have to be bound to turn up every time.\n\nSo it's very flexible and it's good. Awesome. Yeah. And how did you hear about it on this Skype? I retired last year and took up some volunteering, but I knew the boys when they first started 10 years ago in Brisbane. And we used to, have some of our volunteers where I worked there come and join the.\n\nThe work of Orange Sky back then. So connected to it for a long time. And how did you connect that back up with it in Adelaide? Did you pursue it or see it? Oh, just I knew they'd started working 'cause the bus is parked or the, our little van Splasher is parked down the road from where I live and thought it's handy for me.\n\nI can do this and. I come out on a Tuesday night, but here I am on a Friday morning, which is lovely. Just filling in today. And what keeps you coming [00:02:00] back to Orange Sky? Like why do you Yeah, I think it's the friends that come to have the chat and the people that you are on the shift with and it just feels good to volunteer and yeah, I used to work in a school environment before, so that community feel, I enjoy that and I find this is very similar yeah.\n\nAnd what's, has your sort of take on what orange sky does or homelessness or yeah, even like how you talk about with your friends, has that changed over your time volunteering or stayed the same? Yeah, most probably. 'cause as I said, it was an area I wasn't really had much involvement in. And I was really impressed with how the guys have operated it.\n\nI mean they're it's obviously got bigger, but. I think what they're out aimed to do is, hasn't changed. And I think it's helpful. And it's not necessarily just the homeless, it's the people that just don't have those vans that a washing machine might break or can't afford to run it, instead of hitting all people.\n\nAnd I love that it's here and they can go in and [00:03:00] have a meal. So you know, they're getting covered always. What does it I guess what does it feel like for someone who hasn't been on shift? What's a general shift like for yourself or this? So coming as a driver, I head in and pick the van up, bring it down here to Glenelg and try not to crash the van.\n\n'cause that'd be a bit of a disaster if it did. And then we set up and, just starting out, you get to learn how the van works and you've got other volunteers here who've done it before. So you learn and then you just interact with the people who bring their washing in for all sorts of reasons.\n\nYou hear some of their stories, which is really lovely to hear some, it's very sad at times.

So that's the sad part of it, but providing some service, providing some help, it's always appreciated.\n\nYeah. So cool. What's something that surprised [00:04:00] you maybe about R Sky or working here, or friends, so something that surprised you, like after little world of being? I thought in the beginning, and I can't remember it happening, but I remember just getting like a birthday. It can, like happy birthday from the whole orange Sky which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\nSo Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities. It's not an easy task, but I think they do it well. Yeah. Yeah. We operate with our service provider here. What's the relationship like and why do you think it's beneficial to, to work with a I think it's, it gives you a [00:05:00] connection, a reason for being here.\n\nAnd the good part here today, they're getting lunch on Tuesday nights. They get a lovely dinner. And so there's a purpose there. And then the relationship with the people who are coming to work in their volunteer service and we get to know them and they get to know us, and they appreciate what we bring to their community down here.\n\nI'm always fascinated, like Orange Spots had this tagline forever. Positively connecting communities. Yeah. Always been. Yeah, I guess people draw whatever they want from that, but there's a whole range of impact that's available here, which is is washing somewhere, there's showers, sometimes there's conversation.\n\nYou know what I mean? Yeah. Is there something that you think stands out more than others in terms of what impact it might have on an individual? I think it's just nice for some of these people. They might not get to interact very much, especially if they're on the streets and depending on the different where the van goes here, I think it's good 'cause the church has quite a good [00:06:00] idea on them.\n\nBut we were only saying at the start of this year, there's one person that we normally used to see, didn't usually always use. The van would come and chat with us. We haven't seen him come back. And then you keep asking the questions and hopefully someone checks in. And we've heard that possibly he's had a fall.\n\nAnd I think that's a good thing with it is you get those connections and you look out for 'em and yeah, it's just nice to get to know them. Yeah. Yeah. We had a similar one to be heard. Yeah. There was a similar one with a, a young mum and family. And, she hadn't been around for a while, and then she was here a couple of weeks ago and she said, oh no, I'm all good now I've moved to Burra and I've got a house and we've got three little pitties that can run wild.\n\nSo that was, just a positive story to hear from that lady who we'd done a washing for. She'd always arrived late and have a whole swag of washing and Oh wow. Wed get it done. And but yeah, it was lovely to hear that she'd settled and feeling really good. That's cool. Yeah. And [00:07:00] I'm just always interested in what is the influence on you as a person outside of Orange Sky?\n\nDo you think, are there conversations you have that come back about orange sky and your surprise that people's take on it? Or what are those conversations that you have in your social circle? And or even in public, can they be difficult sometimes? I suppose I've got friends that are in that field anyway, but then there's other people you might say you volunteer, just in a general conversation with someone you haven't met before.\n\nThere's a lot of people that still aren't aware of Iron Sky, and then when they hear what it does, they just say, oh, that's fantastic. Yeah, I suppose just trying to get it out there as much as you can, but yeah. No, I think most people think it's a great idea. Yeah. And are there particular challenges of being a volunteer?\n\nI think we've heard a few this morning. The van, yeah, when the van doesn't work, you get, people can't get my drawing done today. Oh it's a where will used asset and it's starting to show [00:08:00] sometimes we're not too bad here, but occasionally I've helped out in a couple of shifts and you get some interesting and.\n\nSort of behaviors, and I know one shift I had a gentleman come up and say, oh, is the van still washing? And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But yeah, it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\n\nSo Yeah. And it's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\n\nWhat's the, what's your feeling about Adelaide in [00:09:00] general in terms of whether it's class or marginalization or struggle what's your general take on Adelaide's? Like temperature or like sentiment? At all that stuff. Is it, do you think it's like high or low at the moment or, I'm not sure.\n\nTension or, I think it's been increasing. I've been in Adelaide, this is my 10th year, and more people who are. Doing it tough and and a lot more people who would be homeless on the streets. And I think we've noticed it here just in the last 18 months, more people coming to get their washing done and you ask them where they're staying and they'll tell you, oh, in this driveway in the winter we are going to a car park.\n\nThose sorts of things. Yeah. But then also just generally, some may not be homeless, but the cost of living pinch is increasing, that's for sure. But yeah. Are there more things you think orange sky should be doing, can be doing? It's always interesting, like I think I heard a stat the other day that orange sky has the second most touch points of people experiencing [00:10:00] homelessness in Australia.\n\nNow, are there things that you think they should do more of? Or do you think they should like fit in their lane what they don't? I think the showers down here might be a thing. Yeah, I think the showers might be handy, but I think they're. I think it's good to keep doing what you do well.\n\nBut yeah, definitely I think the showers and that might help, but like anything new, it takes a while, so it's not just gonna be picked up straight away, so you need to be a little bit. Yeah. Here's some questions more for me, but I, yeah, I'm trying to work out how if you can.\n\nAnd how do you tell stories or do highlights shift that then get shared back? I'm just wondering if you had a way to see what other shifts are doing or what other shifts are like, see videos and photos of other shifts and even like almost search to see sentiment, that sort of stuff.\n\nIs that something you'd be interested in and why? I think particularly other states I think would be interesting to see how it works. Yeah. [00:11:00] Would there be certain ways that you'd love to see that or interact with that? Like it's no. No. Good. Just making another Apple place. I suppose they've got that website and I can't see why you couldn't add it to that.\n\nIt's not always the most user friendly website, but. I'm sure that can improve. Yeah. Just to, have a story, say from, I'd love to see how they work in the remote communities. Yeah. Having spent a bit of time working in those over the years and even in the floods, yeah. Things like that.\n\nSo just have, even if there's just a little, like you say a video of here's what we did in, at T Anger or wherever in, in the Kimberley. And then tell that story. And just have it there so you can say, we've got a new story up and that'll come out on the little message.\n\nHere's the link. So you go in and have a look at it. Yeah. Here's the story from, St. Mary's in Adelaide. Yeah. That's what I'm trying to work out. What's something that you can offer that's not like to some other random place to go over to something That's interesting. And because they do the weekly or the monthly magazine that you get emailed, but.\n\nYou [00:12:00] don't always have time to click into those things. All right. Yeah. 'cause I'd love to even if it's okay to test something with you after this sometime during the week I'll work our away to get like a link to this shift. And you guys, I'm not the best person to do 'cause I'm overseas as of Saturday night.\n\nThat's even better because I wonder, like you when you come back. Yeah, if it's still available and it's, yeah. Like I'd love to work out. I might have access to emails in that anyway when I'm away yeah. Cool. Yeah. 'cause the whole idea of this project is almost like, how do you tell a story but then make sure that there's a participation?\n\nYeah. That's true. Then you, this idea of I think Orange Sky's quite good at promoting themselves on social media and stuff, but I wonder what else we can do to almost like, like we're connecting communities. I wonder how, what else you can do to connect this community up more and because I think they connect to volunteers.\n\nIt's the, the friends that who don't have all the access to media that, how do you, they're good at putting them with venues [00:13:00] that they're coming for, for a meal. So yes, they'll come into the washing, but that must be one of the hardest challenges, I think, for them to, 'cause you've got it.\n\nAnd some shifts would be quieter than others. But. Yeah. Just I'm fascinated at what happens when you give someone agency over engaging as much as they want. Yeah. I was almost fascinated with anyone that wants to sit down and tell their story. So yeah. I just hope that we can find a way where people that tell a story feel good about it and you've done something.\n\nYeah. And they can see it. Yeah. Awesome. Was there anything we didn't touch on that you wanted to say about Orange Sky or talk shit about Nick and Lucas? I've never met them but you on the other hand. Yeah, I met them years ago and gee, they have an age. I reckon because that was so young to start off with, actually, I'll.\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"38:T3ba9,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"Christian Morad - SP - Doveton\n\n===\n\n[00:00:00]\n\nSpeaker: It was totally out of focus learned.\n\nSpeaker 2: Oh,\n\nSpeaker: so this, um, I'm going, going to,\n\nSpeaker 2: will it stay focused or could it come out of focus as like I move, sorry, you've\n\nSpeaker: got two settings.

How would, how do you, like, tell, introduce yourself and identifying that kind of stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I'm a Christian. I am a, I'm an ortho. I practice in an orthodox church here in Hallam. Uh, called Sanmina San Marina. Um, the, my day job is a software developer and I am married to a beautiful Maria Gabriel, uh, for two years [00:01:00] now. Uh, we moved to Melbourne a year ago. We just closed a year, two weeks ago.\n\nAnd, um. Really enjoying the day today. You know, it could be negative to any back home, so I'm very happy with the sun here.\n\nSpeaker: Um, tell us about like, the, um, connection with, um, with the church and how that came about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So, um, I've, I've had, um, a spiritual guide my whole life back home. Uh, home is, um, Toronto, Canada.\n\nAnd, um, it was, it was actually very difficult for me to come here and lose connection with my, uh, with my spiritual guide. I always reli on him with, you know, decisions as to my, my service, my spirituality, um, and my day-to-day life. And then we came here. We actually live in rural. Uh, Gibsland. We don't live here.\n\nUm, and, you know, six months in, I was really struggling. It was the first time, you know, moving from a [00:02:00] metropolitan area to the, the country. It was my first time I was kinda struggling with, we, you know, my wife and I were making a trip every week making sure that we come and connect church and we have communion.\n\nUm, but then I was still, like, during the week it was a bit difficult. I work from home, so kind of connected with my company. On my laptop, but outside of the laptop, there was nothing, uh, other than my wife, which is fantastic. Um, but then eventually it became a little difficult. So, uh, the father suggested that, Hey, why don't you come midweek, do something different.\n\nUm, there's this service running here. Um, I was like, okay, uh, well what is it like? So he described it to me, he said, it's a dinner. You just come and talk. I was like, yeah, great. I'm very good at talking. So, uh, I'll come and talk. Um, more interesting is the listening I've, I've been learning. Um, and uh, actually this is how I met my wife.\n\nWe, we met in soup kitchen back home. Uh, we used to [00:03:00] volunteer at soup kitchen every week for years. Uh, so it's, it's also very, uh, sweet to to be here doing the same thing.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. What's, um, how would you define this idea of connection with people? How do humans connect and why is that important?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great question. Um, humans connect through, I think more than anything, listening, being present in a conversation. Uh, more so listening than talking. Uh, I know, I, I say I love talking, but, but really listening is a lot more powerful in my, in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye, uh, smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt, it builds our fabric together as humanity, uh, to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a, a race, uh, [00:04:00] like um, a bike racer. Someone who worked as. A bodybuilder. People who met here that, you know, lived lives that I've never lived before and I don't think I've ever lived them.\n\nBut through them I'm exposed to part of humanity that I would have no connection with.\n\nSpeaker: That's cool. What, um, from working here, how is your concept of what this idea of experiencing homelessness is, has that changed for you? The more that you've been able to engage with people, or is it, or is it something you've had in that concept with lot?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've had that, I've, I've had a connection with, uh, with, with people of lower income, uh, or people who are struggling with homelessness for years. Uh, I've done it maybe for 10 years back in Toronto. Um, this is different. Every time is different. Every city is different. Every group of individuals is different.\n\nIt's never the same. Uh, I've served in Toronto for people who are on the streets or in shelters. I. Those were very different from people who came to the soup kitchen at church. Those were very different from people who [00:05:00] were of low income status that we used to, you know, go to their buildings and share meals with them.\n\nIn Mississauga, which is a suburb, a suburb of Toronto, very different people are coming here. You know, it's very surprising to me. People, people drive and come here, uh, or pick up their friend and come here or take the train and come here. Um, one thing that is definitely has been evident to me throughout the years is.\n\nNobody wants to be where they are and nobody's scary, which I think is an idea that, um, I had before. It's scary. I'm scared to talk to somebody who looks a bit different, who might twitch or might say something that I'm not comfortable with. Um, but I'm learning. The more I have the conversation, the the less scary it is and the more they're, you know, someone having a bad day.\n\nOr someone who've been having a bad day for so long. Hmm. Um, they're, they're just struggling with a bad day and a smile, a, Hey, how are you doing? [00:06:00] Talk about the weather. Talk about something that I really like doing 20 years ago, will take them in a flash in a to a happy place because I also have bad days.\n\nSpeaker: Totally. You know, it feels. Um, what's, what's your concept of orange sky? Do you know much about it and what do you think about it? I guess?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Uh, can you repeat, oh, sorry.\n\nSpeaker: Um, what's your concept of orange sky as a service and do you know much about it and\n\nSpeaker 2: what's not? So much? So my only exposure is walking in and walking out, uh, seeing that, uh, seeing, seeing the laundry, um, and what I know from people who should sit with me on the table.\n\nThey're very thankful, um, that somebody can take care of their laundry and not only take care of the laundry, but take care of them. Somebody who's gonna talk to them, somebody who's not gonna make them feel like they're, you know, they're their duty, but hey, uh, we're, we're here. We're doing laundry, we're talking, we're making friends.\n\nUm, fellowship is a strong word that we like to use. So having fellowship and not just a duty. I think [00:07:00] also I struggled that a lot for, for a long time, is. Serving as you know, I am here and you are there and I'm putting my hand down to help you. It doesn't feel so good. It is not, it doesn't build the other person.\n\nUm, and what I get from, you know, the, the, the gentleman and the, and the woman that I meet here is, that's not, that's not the attitude. The attitude is we're sitting together. There's no one is putting their hand down. We're sitting together. And that's very powerful.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. That's good. That's a really content.\n\nUm. What's this, what's this idea of story for you? So, the reason I'm doing this is Mm. Um, that we're gonna have lots of different people's telling their story. Yeah. Like what is our stories powerful and why, I guess, like, and, and why is it important to have a range of stories and not just a few?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a really good question.\n\nUm, I think. Uh, so I, I, I've been, uh, born [00:08:00] a Christian, lived a Christian my whole life. Um, I'm a believer and, uh, there's something very powerful about God choosing to speak through stories that says a lot when, when his choice, his defacto choice is a story that says something about the power of a story.\n\nUm, the Bible starts in a story, continues to have story upon story upon story, and tell the story of Christ himself and then the story of the church that we are living today. Um, stories are. Complicated or not complicated. They're complex. They have nuance. They're not bullet points. They're not, they're not flat.\n\nThey're 3D. They're full. They take you up and bring you down. You cry, you laugh. You, you, you feel something and, and you do not get stuck in a linear flat to the sequence of events. Mm-hmm. And. That, that that's what life is like. There's no, it's not linear, it's not flat. [00:09:00] There's so much happening. And when we tell stories, we're able to transport the person from where they are to being in the story.\n\nAnd that's so powerful. It's different from getting a bunch of stats or some information. Uh, it's, it's living something with somebody, which is very different than just getting information\n\nSpeaker: and what's like. I've, I'm definitely not a very good Christian. Um, I used to be good and I've read a lot of, I've read the Bible a few times.\n\nI even read it in Spanish. Um, what's like, and this whole, there's an idea of the word of God, I guess. Um, does that mean that he owns the, the words and the stories, do you think? Like, and, 'cause the reason I'm asking this is\n\nSpeaker 2: mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker: I'm really interested in like, who owns the story once you tell it. So if a friend or someone experiencing homelessness tells us a story and someone goes and [00:10:00] uses it, like, is that okay?\n\nAnd, and how do you, how do you do that properly, I guess is question.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great, that's a great question. I think\n\nSpeaker: about it a lot. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's, that's a great question and, and\n\nSpeaker: I think the reason I asked it was in relation to religion is that I feel like words are sacred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: And to me there's almost like a ownership in that.\n\nThere's like attribution,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker: So how do you do that for everyone, I guess, right? How do you, how do you allow people to attribute their own story,\n\nSpeaker 2: right? And have value that that's, those, those are some really, really big ideas. Really big ideas. Um,\n\nyou know, everything I've read and everything I've, I've, I've learned, uh, and I've come to, says that God very much involved people in writing his story. Um, he did not, you know, some other religions believe that, you know, somebody came and dictated exactly and the words were written. Everything I know about the Bible says that God did not do that.[00:11:00]\n\nThat God showed someone, someone something, whether it was a prophet or a king, or who, whoever was the writer, and then the person wrote what they saw in their own words. A very good example of that is, you know, the, the famous story of creation. That God created the heaven, the earth, and it was good. And then he created the animals and it was good.\n\nAnd then he created men. And it was very good, very unlikely that God was standing there and saying Very good. Most likely not. That's why Moses, this, these are Moses' words expressed to us. You know, everything was good, man was very good. God was very happy with man. The pinnacle, the crown of his creation.\n\nThose are the words of Moses. Those are not the words of God. But it's a story of God creating the world and humanity. So God, you know, the author and the owner of everything has no problem. And actually the delight in giving us, [00:12:00] uh, this, this like to become co-workers with him cot tellers of his story. So how much more, you know, should I allow my fellow human to do that if the creator allows us to do that with him?\n\nUm. That comes with a lot of responsibility. You don't wanna go and bash or ruin the story that someone gives you. And, and, you know, the, the church has a big history of those. We call these heretics. We're not very fond of these heretics. We took those stories and ruined them. Um, and, um, and, and so it should be with, you know, you telling me your story and then I'm going and twisting the story or giving it in the wrong light.\n\nSpeaker: Mm-hmm. It's a great frame. 'cause you know, one of the things I'm really interested in is if someone opens up their whole heart and tells their story and then someone goes and uses it and profits from it, or like, takes a bit of it and [00:13:00] spreads that part, but hides the other part. Mm-hmm. Um, it's almost like, um, you are devaluing that person's intelligence or experience.\n\nMm. And yeah. It's like a, yeah, something. I don't, I don't, I don't know how to solve or to work towards, but um, yeah, I feel like to be able to tell the whole story and then somehow make sure that you deliver the whole story is, is, is somewhat important. Um, and I know that like religion is one of those things that carries a lot of power and worth.\n\nAnd when those words are misconstrued, it can create some really damaging outcomes. Right. So. Yeah. It's, and it's the same with like, um, politics or like, um, yeah. Some of the stuff that happens with hate and things. I think it's, you're right. Words.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: Getting manipulated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think the beauty of religion, um, [00:14:00] at least Christianity, the one that I experienced the most is that I'm, I'm fortunate enough that I can connect with the source of the story.\n\nMm. Uh, I can connect with the author, I connect with God himself. Yeah. And then, you know, double check with him. That this is true. This is, this is what happened. This is what he intended to say. Or, or, or to ask us to do like wiki. Yeah. It is like a wiki. So we're also fortunate in the 21st century that we can go back and find the, the sources to a, to a degree.\n\nYou know, you can never perfectly find the source for everything. But we're, we're fortunate today that this can happen. You know, we're not living two, a hundred, 500 years ago. We know just because someone traveled, they can tell whatever they want, 'cause. How we're gonna go check something that happened, you know?\n\nYeah. 50 miles away.\n\nSpeaker: Go to the next town.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Different story. But today that's not the case anymore. So we're very fortunate that's the case. Uh, I think also puts an onus on each one of us to, when we read something, when we hear something, especially if it touches us. If it angers me, if it excites me, I should go and check.\n\nI should dig a little deeper [00:15:00] and, you know, seeing a source behind the story should gives me more confidence versus seeing something that, you know, is a. I don't know. 15 second TikTok. Yeah. And then I don't know what to make of that.\n\nSpeaker: Uh, I think we, this bloke might have ended our storytelling. The motorbike\n\nSpeaker 2: don't\n\nSpeaker: go perfect.\n\nNo, it's perfect timing. That's awesome, man. Thank you. Thanks man.

I come here on I've only really been coming here the last couple of months because I didn't know about it beforehand.\n\nI found it very helpful. They do a meal, it's like a little camaraderie with a few of the guys that seem to be fairly regular and nice. We've got different ladies that volunteer here, but they also seem to be in a roster. I've seen a few of them a couple of times, and it's just nice to know the washing is washed and dried and I've set for the week.\n\nSuch a simple thing, which for me, I can wash that. I cannot go up and downstairs or hang on my clothes line. So it's been like a massive life save. It's been very helpful. What's the connection like for you here? Like how.\n\nI am like, like I said, I've only been a few months, but everybody seems to [00:02:00] be unusually nice. I was, a bit hesitant. I'm thinking, oh, what sort of people gonna be here? But there's a lovely experience. You've got the regulars, so then you've got some obviously homeless people or people traveling around Australia, whatever.\n\nI'm, I have been surprised that there are people that are literally a holidaying and just i'm living rough for a few weeks so I can get to wherever use the service and that's brilliant. I didn't even know this service existed myself beforehand. That's cool. And what's the, what do you think the main takeaway for you is in terms of what orange Sky does as a whole?\n\nIs it, do you think it's more about the washing, the people connecting the services? I actually. See it's, I do appreciate the washing and especially the drying, but it's the actual, the way the ladies and I've mainly had ladies, we've got she got to, but they just treat you with so well, like you are like bonus friends.\n\nAnd it's just that comradery with some of the workers or volunteers and the the regular people. It's just, I'm really surprised by that. [00:03:00] So That's wonderful. That's good. What, how would you 'cause people struggle, I think to understand what homelessness is, what struggling is, what disadvantage is.\n\nYeah. How do you represent yourself? I guess in that big picture of things, I find myself unusually disadvantaged. I wouldn't have thought I'd be disadvantaged five years ago, but I had a straight four and a half years ago and you cannot access services and so that just made it very difficult. I know I can speak okay, but I walk quite weird and hand functions and what it used to be, so unlikely people.\n\nReally need this service or can access services, but everybody says, oh, wait to go on NOS or wait to. Those things take years and you've gotta get your washing done every week or two weeks. So it's really good to have that service in between. True. And what do you think about life as a whole in terms of the community?\n\nDo you see a lot of struggle or, yeah. I live from Elizabeth, which is like a disadvantaged suburbs supposedly, and I [00:04:00] do see a lot of like homelessness in parks and people going to food vans and all that sort of thing. But I'm. I've only got my advice point of view, but I just think there are a lot of, if people are hungry, especially you can always get food.\n\nBut getting washing done or home, like I know people that are living in cars or doing the couch surfing thing. I. I've got a friend who has only moved to the country. Two years ago she, her and her mom were in long term rental, 19 years. So they presumed it was like their house. They were given three months notice to move by the landlord and they just couldn't afford a place.\n\nSo they bought a dumpy house, middle of nowhere to to stay for roof over their heads. So unexpected people can be homeless. So true. What's it's always interesting to get your take on what this shift is like. So could you walk through how that, how it happened in terms of like A, how did you know about it and then B, what does it feel like?\n\nWhat's it like to be Okay. I heard about like paddle jumpers can paddle [00:05:00] jumpers, and then they, other people told me about the orange sky van, which I thought was very. Help, helpful. I didn't know about it beforehand. I don't use the internet or Facebook or all those sort of normal things 'cause of my funny hand.\n\nSo I was unaware. I'm quite sure that there's advertising, but I just wasn't aware of it. Cool. And what's it what sort of a normal shift look like for you? Normally people try to get here five o'clock for for when the sort of lineup with their washing and the van turns up when it turns up and people are quite happy then people.\n\nYeah, it just seems to be the routine. You get your spot, van turns up, gets something to eat, and then you come back and have a chat around the back of the van. It's mainly being a lady, so it's nice. That's cool. That's awesome. Is there anything that you've always wanted to talk about around Orange Sky yourself that we didn't talk about?\n\nI would like to know how you can advertise it to other people who wouldn't. Like I didn't know about the service point. Who wouldn't normally? [00:06:00] No. 'cause I wouldn't have, I've got a house I wouldn't have considered myself homeless. I wouldn't have known that I needed hands with washing or mainly hanging out.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know how you can actually inform other people. It's a great service. I've been told they go to different places on different days, but I don't quite know if everybody who needs a service knows about it. Seems to be a few regulars turn up, but not other people. Awesome. Such good feedback.\n\nNo worries. I'll I'll have to, yeah. I think the idea with this stuff is like your insight Yeah. And your knowledge Yeah. Is way more than anyone could ever Yeah. From Bruce Head office. Yeah. It's super helpful. Okay, great. Good to help. Thank you.

How would, how do you, like, tell, introduce yourself and identifying that kind of stuff?\n\nSpeaker 2: Uh, I'm a Christian. I am a, I'm an ortho. I practice in an orthodox church here in Hallam. Uh, called Sanmina San Marina. Um, the, my day job is a software developer and I am married to a beautiful Maria Gabriel, uh, for two years [00:01:00] now. Uh, we moved to Melbourne a year ago. We just closed a year, two weeks ago.\n\nAnd, um. Really enjoying the day today. You know, it could be negative to any back home, so I'm very happy with the sun here.\n\nSpeaker: Um, tell us about like, the, um, connection with, um, with the church and how that came about.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. So, um, I've, I've had, um, a spiritual guide my whole life back home. Uh, home is, um, Toronto, Canada.\n\nAnd, um, it was, it was actually very difficult for me to come here and lose connection with my, uh, with my spiritual guide. I always reli on him with, you know, decisions as to my, my service, my spirituality, um, and my day-to-day life. And then we came here. We actually live in rural. Uh, Gibsland. We don't live here.\n\nUm, and, you know, six months in, I was really struggling. It was the first time, you know, moving from a [00:02:00] metropolitan area to the, the country. It was my first time I was kinda struggling with, we, you know, my wife and I were making a trip every week making sure that we come and connect church and we have communion.\n\nUm, but then I was still, like, during the week it was a bit difficult. I work from home, so kind of connected with my company. On my laptop, but outside of the laptop, there was nothing, uh, other than my wife, which is fantastic. Um, but then eventually it became a little difficult. So, uh, the father suggested that, Hey, why don't you come midweek, do something different.\n\nUm, there's this service running here. Um, I was like, okay, uh, well what is it like? So he described it to me, he said, it's a dinner. You just come and talk. I was like, yeah, great. I'm very good at talking. So, uh, I'll come and talk. Um, more interesting is the listening I've, I've been learning. Um, and uh, actually this is how I met my wife.\n\nWe, we met in soup kitchen back home. Uh, we used to [00:03:00] volunteer at soup kitchen every week for years. Uh, so it's, it's also very, uh, sweet to to be here doing the same thing.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. What's, um, how would you define this idea of connection with people? How do humans connect and why is that important?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great question. Um, humans connect through, I think more than anything, listening, being present in a conversation. Uh, more so listening than talking. Uh, I know, I, I say I love talking, but, but really listening is a lot more powerful in my, in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye, uh, smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt, it builds our fabric together as humanity, uh, to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a, a race, uh, [00:04:00] like um, a bike racer. Someone who worked as. A bodybuilder. People who met here that, you know, lived lives that I've never lived before and I don't think I've ever lived them.\n\nBut through them I'm exposed to part of humanity that I would have no connection with.\n\nSpeaker: That's cool. What, um, from working here, how is your concept of what this idea of experiencing homelessness is, has that changed for you? The more that you've been able to engage with people, or is it, or is it something you've had in that concept with lot?\n\nSpeaker 2: So I've had that, I've, I've had a connection with, uh, with, with people of lower income, uh, or people who are struggling with homelessness for years. Uh, I've done it maybe for 10 years back in Toronto. Um, this is different. Every time is different. Every city is different. Every group of individuals is different.\n\nIt's never the same. Uh, I've served in Toronto for people who are on the streets or in shelters. I. Those were very different from people who came to the soup kitchen at church. Those were very different from people who [00:05:00] were of low income status that we used to, you know, go to their buildings and share meals with them.\n\nIn Mississauga, which is a suburb, a suburb of Toronto, very different people are coming here. You know, it's very surprising to me. People, people drive and come here, uh, or pick up their friend and come here or take the train and come here. Um, one thing that is definitely has been evident to me throughout the years is.\n\nNobody wants to be where they are and nobody's scary, which I think is an idea that, um, I had before. It's scary. I'm scared to talk to somebody who looks a bit different, who might twitch or might say something that I'm not comfortable with. Um, but I'm learning. The more I have the conversation, the the less scary it is and the more they're, you know, someone having a bad day.\n\nOr someone who've been having a bad day for so long. Hmm. Um, they're, they're just struggling with a bad day and a smile, a, Hey, how are you doing? [00:06:00] Talk about the weather. Talk about something that I really like doing 20 years ago, will take them in a flash in a to a happy place because I also have bad days.\n\nSpeaker: Totally. You know, it feels. Um, what's, what's your concept of orange sky? Do you know much about it and what do you think about it? I guess?\n\nSpeaker 2: Sorry. Uh, can you repeat, oh, sorry.\n\nSpeaker: Um, what's your concept of orange sky as a service and do you know much about it and\n\nSpeaker 2: what's not? So much? So my only exposure is walking in and walking out, uh, seeing that, uh, seeing, seeing the laundry, um, and what I know from people who should sit with me on the table.\n\nThey're very thankful, um, that somebody can take care of their laundry and not only take care of the laundry, but take care of them. Somebody who's gonna talk to them, somebody who's not gonna make them feel like they're, you know, they're their duty, but hey, uh, we're, we're here. We're doing laundry, we're talking, we're making friends.\n\nUm, fellowship is a strong word that we like to use. So having fellowship and not just a duty. I think [00:07:00] also I struggled that a lot for, for a long time, is. Serving as you know, I am here and you are there and I'm putting my hand down to help you. It doesn't feel so good. It is not, it doesn't build the other person.\n\nUm, and what I get from, you know, the, the, the gentleman and the, and the woman that I meet here is, that's not, that's not the attitude. The attitude is we're sitting together. There's no one is putting their hand down. We're sitting together. And that's very powerful.\n\nSpeaker: That's awesome. That's good. That's a really content.\n\nUm. What's this, what's this idea of story for you? So, the reason I'm doing this is Mm. Um, that we're gonna have lots of different people's telling their story. Yeah. Like what is our stories powerful and why, I guess, like, and, and why is it important to have a range of stories and not just a few?\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a really good question.\n\nUm, I think. Uh, so I, I, I've been, uh, born [00:08:00] a Christian, lived a Christian my whole life. Um, I'm a believer and, uh, there's something very powerful about God choosing to speak through stories that says a lot when, when his choice, his defacto choice is a story that says something about the power of a story.\n\nUm, the Bible starts in a story, continues to have story upon story upon story, and tell the story of Christ himself and then the story of the church that we are living today. Um, stories are. Complicated or not complicated. They're complex. They have nuance. They're not bullet points. They're not, they're not flat.\n\nThey're 3D. They're full. They take you up and bring you down. You cry, you laugh. You, you, you feel something and, and you do not get stuck in a linear flat to the sequence of events. Mm-hmm. And. That, that that's what life is like. There's no, it's not linear, it's not flat. [00:09:00] There's so much happening. And when we tell stories, we're able to transport the person from where they are to being in the story.\n\nAnd that's so powerful. It's different from getting a bunch of stats or some information. Uh, it's, it's living something with somebody, which is very different than just getting information\n\nSpeaker: and what's like. I've, I'm definitely not a very good Christian. Um, I used to be good and I've read a lot of, I've read the Bible a few times.\n\nI even read it in Spanish. Um, what's like, and this whole, there's an idea of the word of God, I guess. Um, does that mean that he owns the, the words and the stories, do you think? Like, and, 'cause the reason I'm asking this is\n\nSpeaker 2: mm-hmm.\n\nSpeaker: I'm really interested in like, who owns the story once you tell it. So if a friend or someone experiencing homelessness tells us a story and someone goes and [00:10:00] uses it, like, is that okay?\n\nAnd, and how do you, how do you do that properly, I guess is question.\n\nSpeaker 2: That's a great, that's a great question. I think\n\nSpeaker: about it a lot. Yeah,\n\nSpeaker 2: that's, that's a great question and, and\n\nSpeaker: I think the reason I asked it was in relation to religion is that I feel like words are sacred.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: And to me there's almost like a ownership in that.\n\nThere's like attribution,\n\nSpeaker 2: right?\n\nSpeaker: So how do you do that for everyone, I guess, right? How do you, how do you allow people to attribute their own story,\n\nSpeaker 2: right? And have value that that's, those, those are some really, really big ideas. Really big ideas. Um,\n\nyou know, everything I've read and everything I've, I've, I've learned, uh, and I've come to, says that God very much involved people in writing his story. Um, he did not, you know, some other religions believe that, you know, somebody came and dictated exactly and the words were written. Everything I know about the Bible says that God did not do that.[00:11:00]\n\nThat God showed someone, someone something, whether it was a prophet or a king, or who, whoever was the writer, and then the person wrote what they saw in their own words. A very good example of that is, you know, the, the famous story of creation. That God created the heaven, the earth, and it was good. And then he created the animals and it was good.\n\nAnd then he created men. And it was very good, very unlikely that God was standing there and saying Very good. Most likely not. That's why Moses, this, these are Moses' words expressed to us. You know, everything was good, man was very good. God was very happy with man. The pinnacle, the crown of his creation.\n\nThose are the words of Moses. Those are not the words of God. But it's a story of God creating the world and humanity. So God, you know, the author and the owner of everything has no problem. And actually the delight in giving us, [00:12:00] uh, this, this like to become co-workers with him cot tellers of his story. So how much more, you know, should I allow my fellow human to do that if the creator allows us to do that with him?\n\nUm. That comes with a lot of responsibility. You don't wanna go and bash or ruin the story that someone gives you. And, and, you know, the, the church has a big history of those. We call these heretics. We're not very fond of these heretics. We took those stories and ruined them. Um, and, um, and, and so it should be with, you know, you telling me your story and then I'm going and twisting the story or giving it in the wrong light.\n\nSpeaker: Mm-hmm. It's a great frame. 'cause you know, one of the things I'm really interested in is if someone opens up their whole heart and tells their story and then someone goes and uses it and profits from it, or like, takes a bit of it and [00:13:00] spreads that part, but hides the other part. Mm-hmm. Um, it's almost like, um, you are devaluing that person's intelligence or experience.\n\nMm. And yeah. It's like a, yeah, something. I don't, I don't, I don't know how to solve or to work towards, but um, yeah, I feel like to be able to tell the whole story and then somehow make sure that you deliver the whole story is, is, is somewhat important. Um, and I know that like religion is one of those things that carries a lot of power and worth.\n\nAnd when those words are misconstrued, it can create some really damaging outcomes. Right. So. Yeah. It's, and it's the same with like, um, politics or like, um, yeah. Some of the stuff that happens with hate and things. I think it's, you're right. Words.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\n\nSpeaker: Getting manipulated.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. I think the beauty of religion, um, [00:14:00] at least Christianity, the one that I experienced the most is that I'm, I'm fortunate enough that I can connect with the source of the story.\n\nMm. Uh, I can connect with the author, I connect with God himself. Yeah. And then, you know, double check with him. That this is true. This is, this is what happened. This is what he intended to say. Or, or, or to ask us to do like wiki. Yeah. It is like a wiki. So we're also fortunate in the 21st century that we can go back and find the, the sources to a, to a degree.\n\nYou know, you can never perfectly find the source for everything. But we're, we're fortunate today that this can happen. You know, we're not living two, a hundred, 500 years ago. We know just because someone traveled, they can tell whatever they want, 'cause. How we're gonna go check something that happened, you know?\n\nYeah. 50 miles away.\n\nSpeaker: Go to the next town.\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Different story. But today that's not the case anymore. So we're very fortunate that's the case. Uh, I think also puts an onus on each one of us to, when we read something, when we hear something, especially if it touches us. If it angers me, if it excites me, I should go and check.\n\nI should dig a little deeper [00:15:00] and, you know, seeing a source behind the story should gives me more confidence versus seeing something that, you know, is a. I don't know. 15 second TikTok. Yeah. And then I don't know what to make of that.\n\nSpeaker: Uh, I think we, this bloke might have ended our storytelling. The motorbike\n\nSpeaker 2: don't\n\nSpeaker: go perfect.\n\nNo, it's perfect timing. That's awesome, man. Thank you. Thanks man.

And I said, yeah. He said alright. I said do you wanna go and get your washing? And he proceeded to strip off everything except his jocks. And that was something I haven't seen here. But it just goes to show that some people are basically living with the clothes on their back.\\n\\nIt's great that we can help them to do, to be able to, wash it for them. And I think it helps concretize other people who I talk to about. The difficulties and challenges of, people who are doing it tough at this time, and I think that helps to raise the awareness of the inequity in our society and hopefully help address that.\\n\\n~~I think it's been increasing.
