13:T513,# The Antidote to Modern Isolation

~~It's just, it's one more thing that we don't have to worry about. So it's appreciated and volunteers and connection and communication and stuff.~~

[00:00:00] isolation is like the struggle of modern society, then connection to communities, the antidote.

I think it's practical. It's practical, more so than anything. It's awesome. Also it speaks to what people that are living on the streets need in a wider sense is access to facilities . There's two types of facilities that would benefit from having community access to the first is necessary.

Utilities like kitchen, shower, laundry. 'cause there aren't spaces where you can just go to do those necessary living function things for free. And the second, third space that would be amazing to see more so in the community is free spaces just to be and to build community from, for example a clothing exchange, like free clothing exchange, [00:01:00] a place with couches, with a kitchen, with a lounge, just to hang out during the daytime.

A place where there's a free bookshelf, a place that encourages free trade. 'cause if you can facilitate an environment where people can help people, that's the best way to solve things. Most people are generous especially people that are in difficult situations.

14:T1c22,# Robyn Watts

[00:00:00] 

Robin Watts. You want to know my life story? Okay. Got two girls. I started out life as a teacher, working life as a teacher.

Didn't like that and got a job in local government, so I ended up the last job I had there for 20 years. And then after I retired, I discovered orange sky and my husband got sick. And he subsequently died. And Orange Sky, as I've told Nic, saved me. It made me get out of bed every day, try and push through the grief, and it's just been the best thing I've ever done, apart from having a lovely family.

Oh, I love it. I just absolutely love it. I honestly believe. [00:01:00] That we give a lot to friends, but they give just as much back. I go home on top of the world some days. Yeah. And I look forward to the days that I'm on shift. I love it. Really love it.

It was compounded, my husband had myeloma and the life expectancy of myeloma now is seven years, and he died after about. Three and a half. So he didn't last very long. But grief for my husband dying was a second wave of grief because six weeks before he died, our 42-year-old son-in-law just died suddenly in Sydney, leaving a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.

And my daughter. And totally unexpected, just completely out of left field. And he was the most wonderful human being. He was [00:02:00] American. And then later on, Ron died. And that was, I think I no, I was in denial of how sick he was. Every time we went to the hematologist, I would. Feel, oh, it wasn't that bad.

It could have been worse, but something happened to his spleen and he just said one night, I feel like I've got a pain in my chest. So I thought it might have been a heart. His heart went into hospital, didn't come out. And ended up in ICU for a week, which was horrible. Horrible. And then went into palliative care and died the next day.

So it was, but he had also been an orange sky volunteer, so I felt like I was carrying on the family tradition too by continuing to do that. But it truly did help me get out of bed. I had to, I had no choice. People depending on you, and without that, I [00:03:00] probably could have stayed. But everybody I know has said to me how well I've coped.

And I think I've coped reasonably well. But I, I miss him. Of course .

I do on my shift on Thursday, we've got, that's the longest shift we've had.

It's the oldest shift and we, the team, I've got the two boys I volunteer with, we've been together for years, probably five years. Or Russ has probably been there nearly seven years. And yes, they were supportive. I was very touched that the team leaders all went to Ron's funeral. Very unexpected. And they've helped me a lot.

But the interesting thing was that the friends. Where my shift on Thursday is the friends knew him too. That was nice, there was a consistency there. But I just I just love it. Absolutely love it. Are there particular things about it that you think are [00:04:00] more profound than others or because I think there's some parts of the, so just simple, but some parts thought out. I think it's, yes, the laundry's important obviously for. People's dignity and they have a right to that. But I think making them feel seen and heard, for me personally, that's really important and genuinely, calling them by name and remembering to ask them something.

One of my favorite quotes is from Maya Angelou says, people will forget what you said, forget what you did. But they will never forget the way you made them feel. And I really believe that. I think that is true for me, but I try to make that true for them too. So I'll, we'll talk about something that's meaningful to them.

I think one of the trickier things is learning to respect and know the [00:05:00] boundaries because some people don't wanna share that much. And we've got a friend who we would, we are very frustrated. We really wanna be able to help him, but he feels that he has enough and he doesn't want to take anymore.

And he struggles, but I've since found out he has got an advocate, which is really good. But that's a failing in the system. I think this particular friend is quite deaf and he's waited probably 18 months to get hearing aids, and I don't know how much they've shown him, but we had a volunteer on the shift one day who'd had some experience as an audiologist.

So she showed him how to put them in and he said, oh, I can hear now, but I don't, he's not doing it himself and we can't offer he's quite private. And he's quite proud, which we respect.

I'm up to my nine years this year, and I wanna get my 10 years, then I'll get my unpaid long service leave.

No, I just, that is [00:06:00] a very concrete goal. I want to get to my 10 years. I've got no intention of leaving at this stage. Sometimes some of the processes that come from HQ can be a bit frustrating. I have to say though, I'd like this on record that my regional coordinator, Carolyn, is superb.

She is the best I've ever worked with. She is just amazing. Her level of support to me as service leader is immeasurable. So she's a buffer between me and the powers that be.

What do you think or hope might happen in the next 10 years or in 10 years time? Oh, that's a good question. On a grassroots level, I hope they keep doing what they're doing. And I hope. They don't diverge too much [00:07:00] from that so that they're trying to do so many things and nothing gets done really well. I remember at the last summit I went to, they were talking about going to San Francisco, and I remember saying Then you need to get it working effectively here before you go anywhere else.

I would like to see, a little bit more acknowledgement of a lot of the services. Like anybody who knew me 9, 8, 9 years ago knew that. I always said, we get forgotten down here. And it, I get that we are a long way away. I understand that. But there are times when we. We can't do the things they can do on the mainland.

So we left feeling a little bit out of things. But in terms of. The the volunteers, I think always uppermost in the minds of the staff should be [00:08:00] what the volunteers are doing because without the volunteers you have no orange sky, you have no ladder to climb, you have nothing. And I think I do what I can for, to acknowledge my team.

We've got a fabulous team of team leaders, wonderful volunteers, absolutely awesome. But sometimes it's nice to. Know that they're appreciated by others. And it's simple things like, it's our birthday in July last year. They put in the newsletter in the Spin Cycles services, birthdays.

They didn't put ours in last year. They forgot it. And that's, I know I get that we are one of however many services in Australia, but to us we are the service in Tassie. So that sort of thing upsets me a little bit.

And I'm proud of Orange Sky. I'm very proud of Orange Sky. I'm proud to volunteer for it. I'm proud of what it [00:09:00] does. And it's, there's nothing better than when I drive to my shift on Wednesday.

Anthony's there waving when I drive the van in, and, it's just such a positive experience all round. But I do think, I do think that they're going to have to be very careful that they don't lose sight of that up there. 

15:T60d,# The Essential Need for Acceptance

~~And so like we just get each other and we've both got autism and a DH. Both dealt with try and we just gel. We just, we just get each other. ~~[00:00:00] So anyway, I put this post up because where, wherever we're living, like whether it's a landlord or whether we're in a share house, whoever we're living with or living in their house, they must be able to accept like the situation.

Because if that isn't the case, it becomes unsafe for us. And I don't worry so much about me because I'm. Very tough. Okay, let's go with that. And I can protect myself, but he is very naive. And if he was to grow up like where I did, I don't know if he would've survived, to be honest. And I just wanna protect him.

Even though typically it's, the masculine role to be the protector, I still see myself that way. All these people on this post, they just responded. Didn't give a shit about, helping people that were like escaping DV from ex-partners. They didn't care about that.

And all they cared about was the fact that we were trans. They just gave us the hardest of times and said all these horrible [00:01:00] things just because we're trans dude and we're not harming anyone. Like we're two trans people that are together. ~~Like we're not a trans person. That's with someone who's born cisgendered, meaning, they were born, the gender they identify with, and it actually relates back to a Greek term that means the same side as meaning. Okay, so you identify the way that you were born. You know what I mean?~~
